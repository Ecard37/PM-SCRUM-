Introduction to Project Management
What is Project Management?
Welcome to "What is Project Management?"
After watching this video, you will be able to define project management, identify the six types of 
project management constraints, and explain the benefits of effective project management
The Project Management Institute defines project management as follows:
"Project management is the use of specific knowledge, skills,
tools, and techniques to deliver something of value to people."
Examples of projects might include the development of software, the construction of a building, or 
a relief effort after a natural disaster.
Projects can be generally defined as a collection of tasks, activities, and deliverables that must be 
carefully organized and executed to produce value.
Project managers are the people responsible for managing this organization and the delivery of 
projects.
Because project management is first and foremost about the management of projects, this makes it 
distinct from general or operations management.
While general management involves the ongoing management of a team, project management 
begins and ends with a project.
Project management begins when a project is kicked off,
and it ends when all project requirements have been completed to the customer's satisfaction.
Although the informal process of managing projects has existed for centuries, project management 
as a distinct practice emerged in the mid-20th century.
It was born out of a need in the aerospace, engineering, pharmaceutical, and telecommunications 
industries to manage projects of increasing complexity.
Effective project management allows companies to increase the success rate of projects, mitigate 
project risks, and reduce overall costs.
For team members, effective project management allows them to better understand their roles and 
responsibilities, collaborate, and utilize resources.
A key aspect of project management is understanding your project's requirements. The entire team 
should agree on the project's goals.
Often, projects are kicked off by developing requirements.
Today, projects are everywhere.
We live in a Project Economy, in which projects are the primary method by which work is 
accomplished, and value is produced.
Project management skills are key for success in a project-based economy.
Project management involves a range of skills, including technical knowledge to interpersonal 
skills.
As a result, it is relevant to a wide variety of roles and situations.
Learning project management can be helpful to everyone, ranging from a student working on a 
science project to an executive negotiating personality disputes.
Project management helps prevent organizations from simply jumping into a new project without a 
plan.
Without proper management, many projects fail to meet their original objectives, if they are 
completed at all.
Project management provides focus and direction for the project team.
It allows businesses to outline their requirements from the beginning, apply project management 
techniques, and monitor project activities.
This mitigates risk by preventing resources from being wasted or put into failed projects.
Project management may reduce risks, but it does not guarantee that projects will not encounter any 
problems or surprises.
Project management will, however, provide standardized practices that can be used to respond to 
and prevent risk.
There are six types of constraints to keep in mind when planning a project.
These are cost, scope, quality, risk, resources, and time.
Cost is the project's budget.
Project management balances the budget so that projects neither overspend nor underspend.
Scope is both the desired features and functions of the final product and the work required to deliver 
them.
Accurately estimating scope is a crucial part of the planning process.
Project quality refers to the standards the project must meet to be effective.
The final product must be able to accomplish its intended task, deliver the expected benefits and 
value, or both.
It must additionally meet certain levels of availability, reliability, and maintainability.
Managing risk means addressing external factors that can potentially harm your project.
It refers to both the probability of these negative events and the consequences if they do.
Resources are what is needed to accomplish the project.
This includes people, equipment, facilities, funding, and anything else required to deliver the final 
product.
Time is the time needed to finish a project.
Tasks and their estimated durations must be accurately identified and estimated to ensure that 
projects stay on schedule.
Balancing these six types of constraints throughout project delivery is the challenge that project 
managers address.
The benefits of effective project management include:
Managing budgets and timelines, so that projects are able to be successfully completed within the 
planned budget and timeframe.
Improving productivity, efficiency, and quality of work.
Addressing project risks proactively.
Improving communication between team members and with stakeholders.
Increasing customer satisfaction by planning and meeting expectations.
In this video, you learned that project management is the application of knowledge, skills,
and tools to a project to deliver intended outcomes and produce value, considers constraints 
including cost, scope, quality, risk, resources, and time, has many benefits, including managing 
budgets and timelines, improving productivity, addressing project risks, improving communication, 
and increasing customer satisfaction.

Expert Viewpoints: What do Project Managers do?

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: What do project managers do?
In this video, we will hear from several project managers explaining what project managers do and 
discussing examples of their involvement with their projects.
If you ever have an opportunity to go ahead and talk with any kind of an experienced project 
manager, ask them what their job description is.
In most cases, you'll hear something like my job is to go ahead and provide new products and new 
services on time, within budget and hopefully within the scheduled timelines that the customer 
requires.
Project managers are responsible for scheduling organization of the overall project,
and in reality, they're actually owners of the project and are held responsible.
Many projects require budgeting, making sure we have resource alignment.
Building those relationships between business stakeholders and internal stakeholders.
I like to believe that project managers are the cement that holds everything together.
You're the person who's in the middle, organizing everything and
bringing all the necessary elements together for successfully completing the work at hand.
And this means that you're working with everyone from upper management
down to every member of your team and figuring out how do you get them into
the optimum position for doing the very best work.
Next, we will hear about examples of projects that these experts worked on
and they will tell us a little bit about their involvement as a project manager.
It starts right from the beginning.
We work internally with cross-functional teams including our sales team.
Our pre-sales team, the consultants,
even our technical account managers for some or our customer success
managers we go ahead and start building the internal relationship from the kickoff call.
We build an external relationship with our stakeholders.
We also help with scheduling, organizing everything, making sure everybody is involved
that should be on the calls,
or just should be notified for any reporting.
So recently I worked with a small company to help them move their systems,
move their customer information to a new customer relationship management tool.
So there was some technology that was being changed.
We needed to train their employees on a new system,
and there was lots to be done in terms of creating some automations, transferring
the data, and really doing that training and creating things like FAQs and documentation.
So one of my roles for one of my roles for the project was to be the project manager.
And so the first thing that I did was I met with the company,
met with a couple of people on the team.
One of the first things that I did was meet with some people
on the team to talk about what the project objectives were.
Our project goals were and kind of get a basic sense of the timeline.
Now, let me tell you about a project I did years ago because it
was really an epiphany about what makes a great project manager.
Years ago I was specializing in fixing troubled projects,
projects that were over budget, behind schedule,
and I was down in Sarasota, Florida managing an HR software development project for Arthur 
Anderson,
and the project was millions of dollars over budget and over a year behind schedule.
Within three weeks, everything was ticking and everyone was shocked that
the project was back on schedule and was hitting deadlines every week
finishing key pieces of it,
and what I found was, the most important thing that a project
manager can do is being the person who can translate between the business and
the dev team in a way that makes it possible for everybody to get what it is they want.
Recently I've been working for Green River College here in the Seattle area.
The college and I decided that perhaps coming up with a new continuing education
program for a business analyst track was a very, very good idea.
We used something called the PDCA methodology. PDCA stands for: plan, do, check, act.
And this is a methodology that is tried and true.
First of all, we did our planning.
We took a look at the potential curriculum,
the potential audience, how long this particular course should take.
Then we went into the D, which stands for do, we developed all of the different courses.
The next step was C, which plans for check.
What we did was we ran a quick beta class.
We got feedback from a lot of the different participants.
We upgraded what we needed to go ahead and fix and then finally the A was act.
We're now ready to go ahead and roll out this new curriculum on a full-time, basis.
An example of a project that I have worked on is a cybersecurity course in the cybersecurity 
program
for UC Berkeley, and my involvement in that process was working with external stakeholders,
which were the faculty, working with our internal stakeholders, which were
several different types of roles,
there were people who were working on graphics where that course people who
are working at production for that course and that people who are also on the support end.
So, my role was to make sure that external stakeholders were very
clear on the different milestones that they had to accomplish in order to make
sure that the internal stakeholders were able to do their job and that
we were able to successfully launch the course on time for our online students.

Program, Project, Portfolio - What's the 
Difference?

Welcome to "Program, project, portfolio - What's the difference?"
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Compare and contrast a program, a project, and a portfolio in project management.
And differentiate between project, product, and portfolio managers.
The terms project, program, and portfolio are often confused or used interchangeably.
However, these terms have distinct meanings in the context of project management.
First, what is a project?
The Project Management Institute, also known as PMI, defines a project as a "temporary
endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result."
Projects are temporary, meaning they have a clear beginning and end.
They are complete when the project goals are achieved or when the project is no longer
viable.
Projects can stand independently or be part of a larger program or portfolio.
A successful project meets or exceeds the stakeholders' expectations.
Projects are distinct from operations.
To determine if what you are working on is a project, ask yourself the following questions:
Is it unique?
Is there a way to determine when the project will be completed?
Is there a way to measure stakeholder satisfaction?
It is a project if you have answered yes to all these questions.
An example of a project might be a social media campaign for a product.
This meets all three criteria from the previous slide:
it is unique because the product will launch only once, it has an end state because after
launch the project concludes,
and produces measurable value, such as the percent increase in product usage after the
campaign.
Next, a program is a group of similar or related projects managed as a group rather than 
independently.
Programs are most useful when a group of projects sees benefits from being managed that it 
wouldn't
see individually.
The goal of a program is to realize the advantages for the entire organization.
Implementing programs makes it easier to determine which projects produce value for the business.
Like projects, programs are temporary organizations.
When all projects in a program are complete, the program is also complete.
All programs share four traits.
They are:
Large, incorporating multiple projects with a wide scope.
Long-term, as it takes a while for a business to see the benefits from multiple projects.
General, able to encompass a range of relevant projects.
Strategic, serving the overall strategic goals of the organization rather than a single project.
An example of a program might be all marketing campaigns that use multiple channels for a
single product,
including social media platforms, digital advertising, and print advertising.
While the individual marketing campaigns in each channel serve as separate projects; together
they form a single marketing program.
By contrast, a portfolio is a group of programs and projects within the same organization.
These programs and projects may or may not be related.
Like programs, portfolios are useful when a group of projects and programs would benefit
from being managed as a whole.
Unlike programs and projects, managing a portfolio is a continuous process,
and new programs and projects are included in the portfolio as they are started.
All portfolio elements must align with the company's overall strategy and goals.
The goal of a portfolio is to help an organization meet its long-term objectives.
If a project is a social media campaign, and a program is the entire marketing campaign
on multiple channels,
then a portfolio would be all the projects and programs that concern the product.
A portfolio could include all social media campaigns for all of the organization's
products.
This might include marketing and other departments such as production, design, and distribution.
As there are differences between a project, program, and portfolio, there are differences
between a project manager, program manager, and portfolio manager.
A project manager has a responsibility to ensure that an individual project is managed
within time, cost, and quality constraints.
They typically focus on how to get work done at a tactical level, and their day-to-day
tasks mainly focus on timelines, resource allocation, and assigning tasks.
A program manager, on the other hand, is responsible for ensuring a larger group of projects is
completed.
They are focused on ensuring that the overall program is meeting key business objectives.
Their day-to-day tasks mainly involve resource management across multiple projects, improving
processes and tools, and tracking long-term timelines and large budgets.
A portfolio manager is responsible for ensuring that groups of programs that may not be related
to one another are being delivered and that they are contributing to broader business
objectives.
They are primarily focused on ensuring that the portfolio of programs is aligned to the
overall organizational strategy.
Day to day, they meet with executives, build portfolio-level roadmaps to provide direction
to program and project managers,
and track and balance resources and costs across multiple programs.
In this video, you learned that:
A project is an endeavor that is unique, temporary, completable, and measurable.
A program is a collection of projects that is large, long-term, general, and strategic
projects.
A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs that is ongoing and aligns with the
organization's strategic objectives.

The Role Project Management Plays in 
Projects
Welcome to "The Role Project Management Plays in Projects."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
List traits of successful project management
Explain the six aspects of a project that a project management addresses
Explain the purpose of monitoring and reporting on a project
As you have learned previously, project management is utilizing skills, tools,
and knowledge to manage projects successfully.
It is used not to manage day-to-day operations but to manage temporary and unique projects.
Karen Tate is president and founder of The Griffin Tate Group, Incorporated,
a Project Management Institute Charter Global Registered Education Provider
specializing in training for the project management community.
She says, "Trying to manage a project without project
management is like trying to play a football game without a game plan."
Successful project management helps create successful projects.
Project management aims to:
Prevent projects from going over budget or running late,
Provide tools like work breakdown structures,
client information sheets, and project plans to help teams navigate their work,
Clarify roles and responsibilities across the team,
Communicate across all project team members and key stakeholders to build alignment,
Manage how the project is delivered, including clarifying dependencies and downstream impacts,
Assess and manage risks and issues that the project faces,
Drive quality assurance for the outputs of the project,
Monitor and report on results to the team, leadership, and key stakeholders,
The purpose of a project is to achieve a particular objective and produce measurable value.
The objective of project management,
on the other hand, is to control how these project goals are achieved.
Project management is about estimating and controlling six constraints:
scope, schedule, financials, risk, quality, and resources.
The project scope establishes objectives, requirements, and extent of the work.
A project schedule determines how and when the work is executed.
Project financials determine how much can be spent to achieve the
project's goals and should be managed for budgeting purposes.
A project risk assessment identifies any events that may have a negative impact
on any other of the project constraints and puts a plan in place to mitigate those risks.
Project quality includes the standards and criteria set by stakeholders and is
managed through quality assurance processes that review a project's performance on a regular basis
Lastly, the project's resources include the people, equipment,
or technology required to complete a project.
You've learned that an example of a project would be a social media campaign for a product.
The successful completion of a social media campaign project would involve
determining the objectives of the social media campaign and
any requirements and scheduling social media campaign releases.
It would also include estimating the cost, ensuring the social media meets
the organization's quality standards, assessing risks such as making sure advertised assets are
in place in a timely fashion, and allocating the appropriate personnel for the work.
Monitoring the status of a project is crucial to project management.
In order to control these six constraints, projects must be regularly monitored.
While monitoring a project's progress against the required objectives and deliverables,
project managers may find they need to adjust the project's schedule or budget.
Monitoring may also identify risks or resource issues that
may require requirements to be altered.
When monitoring a project's progress, project reporting is regularly needed
to communicate the project's status to the team and stakeholders.
Reports should maintain and update the project's
schedule and progress against the requirements and deliverables.
Reports may also contain budget information.
As a project's schedule and budget are living documents,
they may change as the project progresses.
Reporting communicates these changes regarding the project to the team.
Regular reporting should convey information that accurately assesses, reports on,
and notifies team members about any other changes to the project as necessary.
Project managers may use digital tools to monitor and report on their projects.
Project management monitoring tools are used to track the tasks,
due dates, who is responsible, spending, issues, and status of project assets.
For reporting, they may have a presentation template they update
weekly to communicate the status and issues to key stakeholders.
They may also have email templates they use to send out reports on a regular cadence.
In this video, you learned that:
Successful project management keeps projects within budget and on time,
provides needed tools to the team, clarifies responsibilities, facilitates communication,
manages delivery and risk, drives quality, and monitors and reports results
Project management seeks to control the scope, schedule,
financials, risk, quality, and resources of the project
Monitoring is used to assess the progress of a project against its deliverables,
whereas reporting communicates this progress to the team


Expert Viewpoints: What's a project?

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: What's a project?
In this video, we will hear from project managers describing what a project entails and the
role project management plays in a project's success.
Question number one is, what's a project for me to correctly respond to that question,
I'll share the project Management Institute's three-phase definition of a project.
First and foremost, a project is unique.
Every project is different.
A project manager needs to really understand how each project is different and tailor their
planning accordingly.
Secondly, every project has a defined beginning and a defined end.
It's very, very important for the project manager to not only understand when the project
begins, but how it's going to end as well.
What will you do with the final product or service?
Who will you transition it to? the third piece of the PMI definition is all projects are
achieved through progressive elaboration.
What do we mean by that?
When we first begin a project, we really don't understand what the total scope of the project
is.
The first step that you're going to take is creation of a project charter.
This explains the scope at a very, very high level.
Level progressive elaboration means that as we continue to go ahead and understand the
details of the project, we become more and more detailed and more and more granular until
at the end we have a project plan that is detailed to the point where you can execute
the project.
Simply put, it's a sequence of tasks that have an outcome.
With that, it could be easy as making a PB and J.
Okay, so you start with two slices of bread, peanut butter, and jelly, but it's the overall
outcome.
How do you go ahead and create the task in order to complete your PB and jelly?
That way you can enjoy it.
A project can be called any work that is gathered around a specific set of goals.
So what is it that the business wants to accomplish,
and putting it together and understanding how you're going to accomplish it.
So in my experience as a project manager, a project is something that really kind of
has an end date.
It has a specific goal that a team or company is trying to accomplish, and it's really something
that is pretty contained in and of itself.
A project can be anything.
My focus has been in online learning but a project can be anything that has a deadline
that is going to mark its launch or its delivery.
So my focus has been in digital products for online learning, but it can be anything.
What role does project management play in a project's success?
Well, one of the things that you'll learn is RACI.
This is a way of defining roles and responsibilities for a particular team member.
R stands for responsible, A accountable, C console, and I inform.
In a nutshell, the project manager is responsible to do work accountable for the outcomes of
the work.
A consultant in terms of providing expertise and needs to be a provider of information
and a receiver of information as well.
We are the key responsible players that are responsible for the overall project itself.
When it comes to the outcome, somebody is going to have to go somewhere and be like
who's responsible.
They go to the project manager.
They have to manage scope, budget and schedule in order to have a successful project.
Sometimes we might go a little bit out of budget, but where do we budget out from?
Is it going to be from the scope and we're going to do less scope?
Or do we slow down the schedule or speed it up if we have it increased budget?
So this can, you know, vary from team to team, project to project, but very often includes
the project manager in gathering the business requirements,
working with the business analysts and the business side all the way up to the C-suite
to understand what the business.
And then starting the planning.
You have everything from the diplomacy that you have to do in terms of working and inspiring
those that are on your team to dealing with troubleshooting when things go wrong and things
will go wrong.
I believe that a good project manager really helps make a project successful because they
help move that project along.
They help resolve any issues or blockers they have relationships with all of the stakeholders
and they're really able to get clarification on questions if members of the team have questions,
they're able to resolve issues if people on the team have issues.
They're the person making sure that all of the different stakeholders are keeping to
their milestones and ultimately, they're the one responsible, or at least one of the people responsible 
for making sure that the product launches on time.
And if for any reason it doesn't launch on time that the proper communication channel has been 
opened so that it's not going to happen on time, that there's a plan, that someone knows that it's not 
going to happen on time and that there's a Plan B.
So, they're the person shuffling every single different step along the way, making sure
that everyone is successful.

Expert Viewpoints: Misconceptions about 
Project Management
Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Misconceptions about Project Management.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing some common misconceptions about
project management and tasks that fall outside the purview of a project manager's responsibilities.
That's a very easy response for me.
One of the biggest misconceptions is that a project manager has to be the expert.
The project manager needs to be understanding of all aspects of everything that is happening
in the project, that is a huge misconception.
One of my favorite quotes that I've heard in the past is,
"Know what you know, know what you don't know, and surround yourself with people who
know what you don't know."
A good project manager does not quote-on-quote bite off more than he or she can chew.
You need to be in control of the project.
You need to make sure that all of the different moving parts are moving in the right direction.
You do not necessarily have to be the expert.
A lot of the times in terms of their own workload, a lot of people have this kind of misconception
that project managers are there micromanaging people on the team,
and the most successful project managers that I have seen really are there with not only
a vision but a very clear directive,
and then once the team has that directive and they have all the information they need,
they're able to really self-manage even more successfully and efficiently than if they
don't have that information.
Now, a lot of it has to do with the idea that people expect that if you're a project manager,
that you've basically planned out the entire project and scheduled everything.
Some misconceptions about project management are that they are the manager of every single
person on the project.
So an important thing to know about a project manager is that while they're communicating
with different stakeholders along the way,
they are quite often, and most often not the actual manager of those different stakeholders.
So they're managing the task, managing the timeline, but they're not the direct managers
of the different people involved.
So they have to communicate, if necessary, if there's any escalations with those stakeholder's
managers.
So there's a separate kind of dotted line with these roles.
What falls outside the scope of project management?
We always want to plan prior, we workout with the statement of work.
If there is one, we go ahead and all agree.
As far as the scope and then we move forward with implementation, anything outside of the
agreed upon scope is technically considered as either a scope creep or just out of scope
altogether.
I think project managers, while they are responsible for resourcing things like resourcing and
budgets,
they aren't HR professionals or finance professionals so they need to have great relationships with
people in HR and in the finance department,
but they don't need to be responsible or something that falls outside of the scope of project
management is for them to really have those skill sets in human resources and finance.
In terms of what falls outside the realm of project management, my opinion is nothing.
As a project manager, I've been called to add value everywhere from idea all
the way down to final distribution of a product, a website, a piece of software.
So as a project manager, my feeling is you have to be ready to do whatever it takes to
get the job done.
What falls outside of the scope of project management is direct leadership to different
stakeholders.
So as I mentioned previously, stakeholders are not managed by project managers.
The project managers focus on the timeline, so the project manager does not have to be
responsible for different parts of each stakeholders' jobs.
Their only focus on the timeline, on communicating obstacles across the team, and making sure
that they're removing those obstacles,
but they are not the actual leadership member that is directly involved with managing each
stakeholder.

Who Project Managers Work With
Welcome to "Who Project Managers Work With."
After watching this video, you will be able to list who project managers interact with when 
managing projects, and summarize the types of interactions project managers have with those they 
work with.
Stakeholders are individuals, groups, and organizations that can impact or be impacted by a project.
This can include impact during the production of the project, or it can include impact after the 
completion of the project.
Basically, anyone involved with the project is a stakeholder.
Engaging with stakeholders is essential to managing projects.
Project managers must be able to effectively identify, analyse, and proactively engage with 
stakeholders from the beginning to the end of the project.
By effectively interacting with various stakeholders, project managers and stakeholders alike can 
align their goals with the project's objectives.
This also allows the project team to adjust the project in response to changes and new 
developments.
Some key individuals and teams that the project manager interacts with include:
Executives,
Legal,
Sales and marketing,
IT,
Operations,
HR and recruiting, External stakeholders, and Project teams.
Project managers work with executives on a number of different tasks.
Executives must work with project managers without their roles overlapping.
Project managers work with executives to:
ensure their roles do not overlap, align the project to corporate strategy, communicating a goal and 
vision for the project,
build support for the project and gain assistance evangelizing, encourage and champion team 
members, work to gain budget and resources for the project, and create an environment for the 
project manager and team to thrive.
Project managers also work with legal teams.
Interactions with legal teams are especially necessary when there are specific laws,
contractual obligations, and legal concerns that the project and its team must pay attention to.
Project managers may also work with the legal team
when they are involved in contracts for project work.
Another department that project managers may work with include sales and marketing.
There are interactions with sales and marketing if the project produces a product or service to sell,
or it changes an existing product or service,
sales and marketing departments will likely be involved.
Sales and marketing departments can provide crucial information on sales, messaging, and customer 
satisfaction.
Project managers will also work with the IT team to manage any systems, internal or external, 
required for a project.
IT will provide technical support to the team for project success.
If the project involves software development, project managers will need to work with developers 
in IT as part of the project team.
In some instances, IT professionals can be leveraged as members of the project team in order to 
lend technical support.
Project managers may also work with the operations department.
If the project delivery or outcomes will impact how the organization functions.
The project manager will also involve operations to ensure a smooth project transition from 
development into operations.
Another department that project managers may work with is human resources, often referred to as 
HR and recruiting.
Since project managers are responsible for managing labor resources and the team members 
involved who work on a project, they may need to bring people in from other departments or hire 
external personnel or contractors.
In these cases, HR and recruiting can help project managers get the workers they need.
Project managers interact with many people outside the organization.
Individuals they frequently meet with include:
suppliers who provide a service required for the project, clients who request the services or the 
product being developed for the project, customers who may be contacted if they are involved in the 
design or testing of the product, and consultants who provide expertise on one or more aspects of 
the project.
Finally, the project team is also a group of stakeholders.
Project managers work with all team members to gather status, manage issues and risks,
drive the timeline and budget, and more to support the project's completion.
Project teams actively work with other stakeholders in order to ensure that
everyone understands the other's interests, needs, and opinions.
This maximizes project performance and outcomes, and it increases stakeholder satisfaction.
In this video, you learned that project managers work with executives, to align projects to corporate

Working Across Teams, Functions, and 
Different Organization Structures
As you have learned, project management is the process of planning, organizing, and leading a team 
to achieve specific goals and objectives. It is a critical function in any organization, as it helps 
ensure that projects are completed on time, within budget, and to the satisfaction of stakeholders. 
One of the key challenges of project management is working within different organizational 
structures and across different teams, as it requires effective communication and collaboration to 
ensure that everyone is working towards the same goal.
In the article, the following organizational structures are discussed:
•	Vertical or hierarchical
•	Matrix
•	Functional
•	Flat or horizontal
•	Hybrid
In addition, the following teams are discussed:
•	Executive staff
•	Legal and compliance
•	Finance
•	Marketing
•	Design
These structures and teams are used as examples throughout the article to discuss the unique 
challenges and considerations that project managers must keep in mind when working with them 
and how to navigate within each structure accordingly.
Working Within Different Types of Organizational Structures
The type of organizational structure can have a significant impact on project management and the 
role of the project manager. Each structure has its own characteristics and challenges, and the 
project manager must be aware of these to effectively lead the project and navigate the organization.
Hierarchical or Vertical Structure
In this type of structure, a clear chain of command and decision-making authority flows from the 
top of the organization to the bottom. Project managers in this structure may face challenges in 
getting buy-in and support from upper management. They need to ensure that project goals and 
objectives are aligned with the overall organizational strategy and that they keep upper management 
informed of the project's progress and any issues that arise.
Matrix Structure
This type of structure is characterized by cross-functional teams that work together on specific 
projects or initiatives. Project managers in this structure may have more complex relationships to 
navigate, as they must manage multiple stakeholders. They need to be skilled in communication and 
collaboration and effectively lead and manage cross-functional teams. Additionally, project 
managers need to be able to navigate the different priorities and goals that each functional team may 
have and align them with the overall project goals.
Functional Structure
This structure is organized around specific functions or departments, such as accounting, marketing, 
or human resources. Project managers in this structure need to be aware of the different processes 
and systems used by each department and ensure that they are working with the right experts in 
each area. They may also need to work closely with department managers to ensure that project 
goals and objectives are aligned with the goals of each department.
Flat or Horizontal Structure
This type of structure has a relatively flat hierarchy with few or no levels of management. Decision-
making authority is distributed among all employees, and there is little centralization of control. 
Project managers in this structure need to be comfortable with a high degree of autonomy and be 
able to lead and inspire the project team with minimal oversight. They may also need to build 
consensus among team members, as there may be fewer formal structures in place for decision-
making.
Hybrid Structure
This type of structure is a combination of two or more of the above structures, tailored to suit the 
specific needs of the organization. In this case, the project manager must be aware of the 
organization's characteristics and goals and adapt the project management approach accordingly.
In all cases, project managers need to be aware of the decision-making process, have the skills to 
plan and lead the project accordingly and align the project efforts with the organization's goals and 
objectives. The structure of an organization can significantly affect the complexity and effort of a 
project, and a good project manager will be adaptable and able to work effectively within the 
structure of the organization.
Working across different teams and functions 
While there are different organizational structures, many organizations have similar functions and 
teams. When working across different teams, project managers must be able to effectively 
communicate and coordinate with a wide range of stakeholders, including executive staff, legal and 
compliance, finance, marketing, design, and other functional teams. Each team may have unique 
goals, objectives, and responsibilities, and the project manager must be able to align these with the 
overall project goals and objectives.
Project managers must keep in mind the unique challenges and considerations when working with 
different teams. Some strategies that project managers can use to effectively manage these 
challenges and foster productive relationships with each team include:
Executive Staff
Project managers must be able to clearly communicate project goals and objectives, timelines, and 
expectations to the executive team and be able to effectively listen and respond to feedback. They 
must ensure that project goals and objectives are aligned with the overall organizational strategy 
and keep upper management informed of the project's progress and any issues that arise.
Legal and Compliance
Legal and compliance teams may have specific regulations and guidelines that must be adhered to. 
Project managers must work closely with legal and compliance teams to ensure that projects are 
following all relevant laws and regulations and to mitigate legal risks. They should also be aware of 
any legal considerations that might affect project schedules or costs.
Finance
Project managers must work closely with finance teams to ensure that projects are completed within 
budget. Project managers may work closely with the finance teams to develop a detailed project 
budget, including all expected costs, such as labor, materials, and equipment. They will also 
regularly update the budget, track actual costs throughout the project, and take guidance from the 
finance team on how best to allocate resources based on the budget.
Marketing
Project managers must work closely with marketing teams to ensure that the organization's products 
or services are effectively promoted to customers and the general public. If the team is developing a 
new product or service, project managers may work with the marketing team to understand the 
marketing timeline for launching the new product.
Design
Project managers must work closely with design teams to ensure that visual designs and concepts 
are consistent with the organization's branding and aesthetic requirements. Project managers may 
also work closely with design to gather user feedback and do user testing. The project team may 
also depend on the design team for user experience/user interaction designs, so the project manager 
will need to communicate with that team to ensure project plans include those considerations.
With all teams, it is important to maintain open lines of communication and actively seek feedback 
from all team members. Regular project status meetings, workshops, and report-outs can help keep 
everyone informed and on the same page. Also, involving key stakeholders and team members in 
decision-making processes and seeking their buy-in can help build trust and buy-in for the project.
Finally, it is essential for the project manager to have the ability to navigate across different 
cultures, backgrounds, and working styles, which will greatly help in fostering productive 
relationships with each team and across organizational structures.
Conclusion
Project managers must navigate complex organizational structures and many functions and teams, 
as well as many cultures, backgrounds, and working styles. With that in mind, effective 
communication is crucial as it helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that any issues 
or concerns are addressed in a timely manner. Collaboration is also essential as project managers 
must be able to bring together different perspectives, ideas, and expertise to achieve the project 
goals and objectives. They must be able to establish clear roles and responsibilities for each team 
and create an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas and providing 
feedback. Finally, this requires a high degree of flexibility and adaptability and a deep 
understanding of each team's unique characteristics, goals, and processes.
In summary, effective project management requires the ability to work across different teams, 
navigate complex stakeholder relationships and align the efforts of multiple parties toward a 
common goal. Successful project managers are skilled in communication, collaboration, 
adaptability and are able to work effectively with a wide range of stakeholders to achieve project 
objectives.
Project Management Methodologies
Welcome to "Project Management Methodologies."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
"Explain the purpose of the Project Management Body of Knowledge.
The P. M. B. O. K. List commonly used project management methodologies
Compare and contrast project management methodologies, including waterfall, critical path, critical
chain, agile, lean, and Six Sigma
The Project Management Institute, known as the PMI, is a leader in project management
and provides a set of project management guidelines called the Project Management Body of 
Knowledge,
or PMBOK.
The PMBOK is a set of project management guidelines, best practices, and processes.
The PMBOK intends to make project management more effective within cost, scope, and time
constraints.
The PMI provides a certification based on the PMBOK, called the Project Management
Professional, or PMP, certification.
The 7th edition, or PMBOK, was released in 2021.
PMBOK 7 shifted from PMBOK 6's phase-based project management to principles-based project
management.
With the principles-based project management focus, the PMBOK7 enables the guidelines
to be readily applied to different types of projects
- say to a manufacturing project instead of a software development project.
Details and tools are provided for each principle.
The PMBOK 7 also enables tailoring the project management approach to a suitable adaptation
for that project's environment.
The PMBOK can be applied via a wide variety of project management methodologies.
We will discuss several: waterfall, critical path, critical chain, agile, lean, and Six
Sigma.
The waterfall method is one of the oldest project management methodologies.
It consists of linear, non-overlapping phases, including identifying requirements, analysis,
design, building, testing, and operations.
It is a rigid, structured approach to project management that doesn't provide flexibility
for changing requirements.
The structured approach to managing the project, gathering product requirements, and gaining
approvals helps to minimize cost overruns if the estimation is accurate and requirement
changes are minimal.
The critical path method of project management is like waterfall but accounts for dependencies.
The project manager works with the stakeholders to identify and order requirements using a
work breakdown structure.
Each task's completion time is estimated.
Like waterfall, the critical path method does not provide room for changing requirements.
In this example, you see three paths that can be worked on simultaneously.
The critical path is the path that takes the longest amount of time.
The critical path is shown here in blue.
Since the critical path is the longest, it estimates the length of the project.
There are three main parts to the critical chain method: the critical path,
the feeding chain, and resource buffers.
The feeding chains are concurrent, secondary paths to the critical path, also comprised
of dependent tasks.
The feeding chains eventually merge into a single task within the critical path.
Resource buffers are additional resources built into the critical path to provide a
measure of leeway in the critical path in case the path does not go as planned.
Resource buffers include additional team members, equipment, or time to the critical path tasks.
Agile was designed to address waterfall's shortcomings, namely its inflexibility and
changing requirements later in the process.
Instead of having long and strict project phases, the project is run in iterations that
are typically two weeks, called sprints.
Design decisions, implementation decisions, prototypes, and client feedback are processed
during the sprint, consistently allowing the stakeholders to provide regular feedback,
and consequently iterating on the project's development.
Agile is often paired with other, more robust project management strategies such as Kanban,
scrum, or extreme programming.
Four core values govern Agile methodology.
These values are
individuals and interactions over processes and tools,
working software over comprehensive documentation,
customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
responding to change over following a plan.
It also has 12 guiding principles developed to produce self-governed, highly collaborative,
and adaptable teams.
The lean project management methodology focuses on delivering value and minimizing the waste
of resources or time.
One of the key principles of lean is flow.
Flow is about moving the product through stages quickly, continuously, and efficiently, making
room for the next.
Work is done in a steady flow rather than in batches.
While Agile has bi-weekly sprints, lean is a continuous pipeline.
Agile is well-suited for development processes such as software, whereas lean is better applied
to production.
The Six Sigma Method is a collection of tools and techniques to improve processes. This
method originated in manufacturing and is data-driven.
The term "Six Sigma" comes from statistics referring to the number of defective products
that are equal to or less than six standard deviations from the mean in a normal distribution.
The Six Sigma methodology is often credited with revolutionizing quality management by
innovating it into its profession versus something handled by the production team.
To apply the Six Sigma method, accurate data is needed.
One of the main criticisms of this method is the over reliance on this type of documentation.
In this video, you learned that:
The PMBOK is a set of project management best practices, guidelines, and processes
intended to make project management more effective.
Waterfall, critical path, and critical chain methodologies use a linear, structured approach
where tasks take place in either mutually exclusive phases or sequences.
Agile focuses on development, and development is run iteratively, where iterations consistently
improve on the previous one.
Lean is focused on continual production flow while delivering value and minimizing waste.
Six sigma is data-focused and manufacturing-driven.

Expert Viewpoints: Project Management 
Methodologies

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Project Management Methodologies.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing the project management methodologies
they have used as a project manager, such as agile, waterfall, or something else.
At my company, we do a lot of technical implementations directly with frontline
customers, whether it's from finance, health, tech, whatever it might be.
We have so many different types of companies,
typically at my company we do like to go ahead and use hybrid or agile methodologies.
They just are best fit for our company.
However, we do see many different types of customers that have preferences,
whether it's agile, waterfall, hybrid scrum and we go ahead and just customize towards them.
As a project manager, I've used a variety of methodologies.
The two biggest ones being both Agile and waterfall.
So I cut my teeth early stages of the computer revolution as a
waterfall project manager using Microsoft Project.
But even then, In the early days, well before, Agile was a formulated methodology.
We were often using agile techniques,
everything from having stand ups daily generally in the morning.
But depending on where the team was, it could be spread around
all the way to how we were formulating our ability to do rapid prototyping.
And then within that, you know, the beauty of really learning
all the different things that can be used to properly manage your
project is creatively putting those together depending on the project.
The most common methodology that I have used in my career has been a hybrid model.
A hybrid approach where you do most of your work day-to-day, work in an agile fashion.
You have all of the agile ceremonies like daily stand-ups and retrospectives,
but a lot of the work is also kind of managed at a higher level in a waterfall approach,
so a lot of the work that I have done has been in a kind of a hybrid agile waterfall approach.
In my experience, I've had the opportunity to manage
and be part of a variety of different projects.
I've been part of typical waterfall projects where we plan, we do, we check, and we act.
I've been part of agile projects as well where we plan, do, check and learn.
The one piece of advice that I'd like to go ahead and share with you in terms of
choosing a methodology was developed by a gentleman named Ralph Stacy.
Whenever you are encountered with the challenge of managing a new project,
look at two aspects of the project. Aspect
number one, how much agreement is there among stakeholders in terms
of the deliverables that are going to be required?
Consideration number two, how complex is technology and how much innovation
and creativity is going to be required.
If the agreement on what success looks like is low and the complexity is very, very high,
then I recommend that you lean toward an agile methodology to complete the project.
If the agreement among stakeholders on deliverables is very, very high and the
complexity is relatively low, then in all likelihood a predictable waterfall
project will be most appropriate for you to be successful on the project.
The methodology is that I have used in my own projects,
have been both waterfall and agile timelines,
and when I first started in overseeing projects it was very waterfall based
because the volume of projects was not as big as it was later on in my career.
So the waterfall method was really good for having a smaller amount of projects,
where we could manage these waterfall-style milestone calendars for different stakeholders.
Agile really came into play when there were a lot more projects that were launching all at once.
My experience has been online learning so to put that into perspective, I could have been
at one point launching maybe two or three quarters, two or three courses a quarter,
where later on in my career it was a lot closer to 10 courses per quarter.
So that meant having to be a lot more agile in the calendars and
being able to actually be identify points of flexibility and also open
up better communication channels to launch the courses on time.

Traditional vs Modern Project Management
Welcome to "Traditional versus modern project management."
After watching this video, you will be able to
describe features of traditional project management and modern project management.
Compare and contrast advantages of modern and traditional project management
Traditional project management is based on predictable cycles, processes, and tools.
This is, in part, what has made it so successful for so long.
Rather than working in short cycles, on atomic pieces of work,
traditional project management plans the work linearly from start to finish,
that is executed sequentially with a focus on upfront planning, documentation,
and the project management lifecycle.
Changes are only made when necessary.
But there have been several shifts in project management towards a more modern method.
Modern project management is the type of project management
that you have been learning in this series.
Instead of large, inflexible projects, modern project management breaks large objectives
into smaller, more manageable pieces with clear end goals.
Modern project management often incorporates an agile, or hybrid, project management 
methodology
allowing teams to be more flexible in their scope, processes, and tools.
As organizations have evolved to be more fast-paced and global,
modern projects have required an evolution of project management.
Traditional project management involved static, fixed, projects where,
timelines, budgets, deliverables, and resources changed infrequently.
Requirements were set at the beginning of the project and changed little.
In contrast, modern project management involves projects that fluctuate.
They require fluidity and must be managed such that they are agile and flexible.
Development happens iteratively.
They are often large and involve multiple teams working together.
Due to trends in globalization and remote work, and the development of project
management and collaboration software, modern projects can also now be managed virtually.
The evolution to modern project management has several advantages, including:
Increased flexibility that allows organizations to
respond to changing business objectives, competitive pressures, or global events.
Faster time to market,
Identifying and fixing issues more quickly, increases in productivity and retention,
Capital and operational cost savings from a remote workforce.
There are also a few disadvantages of modern project management:
Teams can lose sight of the overall vision and objectives for a project,
so the project can seem to have no "end"
Project deliverables can go to market unfinished,
with the view that the team will complete it later.
Since teams focus on delivering project deliverables, necessary
documentation can be forgotten or incomplete.
Team members can feel as though they aren't connected to the organization
or that they aren't supported. There have also been shifts in
how organizations are structured and operate that have had an impact on modern project 
management.
Organizations have become far more global with the rise of modern technology.
Many organizations have teams that work across time zones and countries.
This means that organizations have diverse
cultures and have a more flexible work environment.
Globalization, and an increase in remote work,
also means that more work is done virtually and globally.
Project management and collaboration tools have also supported this shift.
While many organizations have evolved their project management styles,
modern project management has both advantages and disadvantages.
Agile project management methods allow organizations
to manage projects with more flexibility.
That increased flexibility allows organizations
to change their project deliverables or outcomes based on any number of factors.
This means that organizations can more easily adapt in an ever-changing world.
But this flexibility can also become a disadvantage when an organization does not have
a clear vision at the beginning of the project, or it changes its project objectives many times.
Teams can lose sight of what they are working on,
and it may feel like there is no definite end to the project.
Modern project management methods also focus on increasing an organization's time to market.
While this is a benefit, as organizations can start realizing value from their
projects more quickly, occasionally project deliverables can go to market
unfinished as teams believe they can just complete it in the next cycle.
Another benefit is that teams can identify and fix issues with project deliverables more quickly.
But, since teams are focused on delivering project deliverables quickly, and fixing
issues, there is often a lack of focus on documentation and reducing technical debt.
Finally, the rise of automated tools and
software has also provided modern project teams several advantages.
New collaboration tools allow teams to collaborate more effectively as well as virtually.
Additionally, new tools can automate the time-consuming,
manual processes in traditional project management, such as spreadsheet calculations,
report building, monitoring, and exporting data.
These tools give project managers more control and flexibility, allowing them to spend more time
optimizing the project rather than spending time performing tasks that can be automated.
Finally, globalization, remote work and the rise of project management tools
and software allows teams to work virtually from all over the globe.
This gives organizations increases in productivity and employee retention.
It can also create capital and operational cost savings by having a remote workforce.
But, in a virtual and remote work model,
team members can feel as though they aren't supported, or connected to the organization.
In this video, you learned that:
Traditional project management is predictable,
continuous, and sequential, and it requires planning beforehand.
This stability is an advantage of traditional project management.
Modern project management is flexible, used for unique projects,
and can be started without planning a project all the way to the end.
Some of the advantages of modern project management include being able to respond
to changes and client feedback, having more flexibility in how work is accomplished,
and using tools to automate management processes.

Recent Trends in Project Management
Welcome to "Recent Trends in Project Management."
After watching this video, you will be able to
list current trends in project management, and
summarize how current trends impact the project management role.
Current trends in project management include an emphasis on the use of:
Artificial intelligence, or AI,
project management software,
data analytics,
remote teams and a global workforce,
hybrid project management methodologies and
soft skills.
Recently, more and more organizations have been adopting the use of Artificial intelligence,
called AI, across their businesses.
The use of AI benefits organizations, and project managers, in multiple ways.
AI can provide insights to project managers and
stakeholders by quickly analyzing previous project performance data.
With this data, as well as data from other sources,
AI can also be used to estimate resource and budget usage and predict risks and issues,
helping organizations plan projects with a higher degree of confidence
and make quicker decisions while mitigating risks more accurately.
Additionally, in the near future, AI is expected to be able to automate many
minor administrative tasks that project managers currently do,
allowing them to focus more on higher-level, strategic activities and planning.
AI could assist project managers by automatically allocating
resources and updating the project schedule and budget based on data.
Thanks to the introduction of AI and cloud technologies,
project management software has also been upgraded.
Project management tools such as Asana, Wrike, and Trello are now cloud-based
and utilize AI features to facilitate efficient project management operations.
A major benefit of project management software is
that it allows all stakeholders to easily track project status at any given time.
Project management tools can help project managers automatically track costs and time
spent working on tasks and use that information to develop cost and resource projections.
These projections can help project managers see potential risks and
issues earlier in the project and make course corrections based on the data.
Additionally, project management software is often used across
all an organization's projects and programs.
This allows organizations to monitor their projects to have a better
understanding of how their projects and programs are working together,
and helps executives make quick, strategic decisions on staffing,
cost saving measures, technology decisions, and more.
Project management software, and the adoption of AI, have given project
managers and project stakeholders access to more data than ever before.
As discussed, that data is used to help everyone
from project managers up to the C-suite make decisions.
Project manager can use data to estimate scope, measure project progress, and assess risk.
But, an abundance of data has also required the adoption of data visualization tools.
Tools like IBM Cognos, Looker Studio, or Tableau can take project and resource data,
and combine it with other data from the organization to develop a complete picture
of key performance indicators and project health.
Another trend in project management is the rise of virtual teams.
Because of developments in technology, changing corporate values,
and the growth of the gig economy, virtual teams have become more common.
The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 also increased the adoption of
work-from-home policies that allowed some team members to complete work from nearly 
anywhere.
Collaboration tools such as Slack, Zoom,
and Microsoft Teams, along with project management software such as Jira,
help teams to work together even when they are working across different time zones.
These tools are particularly helpful for project managers
who manage numerous resources across different locations.
Hybrid project management methodologies are another trend that has been increasing in recent 
years.
Hybrid project management methodologies incorporate different project management
methodologies such as agile, scrum, XP, scaled agile framework , waterfall, and lean.
Organizations are increasingly turning to hybrid methodologies to address the need for flexibility.
This allows organizations to find a unique approach that works best
in a particular situation, project, or industry.
This means that project managers must be familiar with many project management methodologies,
but also gives them a broader toolbox with which to manage projects.
Finally, with the development and adoption of numerous AI tools,
and project management software, as well as the rise in remote (or hybrid remote) teams,
the project management profession has seen an
increase in the need for project managers with strong soft skills.
Skills such as emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, communication,
negotiation, and mentoring are in high demand.
As new technologies like AI and project management software handle more administrative work,
project managers are now focusing on other
responsibilities that require some of these key soft skills.
By developing these skills, project managers are able to better contribute to a project's success.
In this video, you learned that new trends in project management include the use of:
Artificial intelligence, which can automate administrative tasks.
Project management software, which can help project managers monitor
a project's resources and schedule in real-time.
Data analytics, which can help organizations make data-driven decisions about their projects.
Remote teams and a global workforce, which allow teams to work across locations and time zones.
Hybrid project management methodologies, which apply
multiple project management methodologies to the projects they are best suited.
Soft skills, like communication, which are increasingly valuable
as emerging technologies do administrative work.

Expert Viewpoints: Trends in Project 
Management

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Trends in Project Management.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing the
evolution of project management and what they like or dislike about recent trends.
I'm going to go ahead and share two terms with you: #1 virtual,
#2 technology.
Virtual has become a key consideration in project management.
We, as project managers, no longer have the luxury
of having an in-place team co-located where we can meet and greet each day.
So, a project manager needs to be well-versed in how to
handle a virtual project and the tools and techniques that are available to him or her.
The second is technology.
In the past, project management was very easy.
Make sure that you have a pad of paper and a pen and write good notes and send emails.
Now we have a variety of different platforms.
We have JIRA, we have Teams, we have Asana, we have Box.
You name it, there's a different technology that is out there that
can greatly assist us in managing our projects,
but the key challenge is learning them.
From my last company where I was in office over to where I'm currently at,
which is fully remote, things have changed majorly in project management.
Previously everything had to be in-person meetings.
We thought that it would be much better for our business relationship.
Which is great to meet people in person, of course, and have that face-to-face,
you could see their emotions, their body language.
However, in the new space of remote, you can reach out to
anybody at any time and have a quick response just through a quick chat.
A big thing that's changed just recently for most of the world is working with remote teams.
That's, you know, caused a lot of challenges for project management. From as simple as dealing
with the time differences of working with offshore teams or teams in other places.
You have to deal with differences in culture attitudes.
You know, it, it becomes a little bit more complicated, you know, motivating your team,
working with them, putting together a way so that the workflow is going smoothly.
The proliferation of the cloud and cloud-based tools like JIRA,
cloud-based tools like Trello and Asana, that have really allowed us to digitize things,
like user stories and then using data and now artificial intelligence to
really help us understand things, like what is our burndown rate,
how many people do we need on a project at any given time,
and what does our resourcing look like for the next three to six months for this project?
There's a lot more tools out there that use data,
artificial intelligence, that use the cloud for even basic communication.
The ways of project management have evolved over time tremendously.
When I first started, I feel like I know Agile has been around for a while,
but when I started we were definitely a lot more focused on waterfall methods,
and Agile really didn't come into play later, and especially as our teams became more dispersed.
It became really important to be honed in on one method of project managing.
So, if we were managing a few projects that were going to launch per quarter, but it changed to
managing twice, double, triple or that we had to update our methods to be more agile,
but we also had to identify which ways agile is going to work for us.
So that meant not just having once-a-week project meetings for updates,
it meant having daily stand-ups, which were really helpful when our team members were dispersed.
So, I had team members in New York, I had some in Chicago, I had some international
members, so we had to identify key points for us to be able to
meet and be able to communicate about the projects at stake.
What do you like or dislike about new ways of project management?
I truly love the opportunity of being able to work with everyone virtually.
I can easily talk to people that are in cross-functional teams, like my sales team over to
marketing or product management and having those true live updates within a matter of seconds.
Some of the dislikes is definitely it's much harder to build those
relationships because it's quick answers.
You don't get to see everyone.
Plus, sometimes, especially when you're meeting with your stakeholders,
you wanna know what they're thinking,
and when you see them in person at least you can see their body language and their overall tone.
You can get some of that over a call,
especially like a Teams meeting, for example, or Webex.
However, you don't see it all, especially if we don't use cameras.
There's a lot of data out there and as we move as project managers, move information and manage
their projects using these tools. It's very easy to get bogged down in all of the data
and all of the reports that are available and all of the information that's out there
and really to not only overwhelm themselves, but overwhelm their teams, their stakeholders with.
You know, just massive processes or lots of
information that they don't need to get a project done.
What I like about new ways for project management is that there
are so many more options to be able to manage projects,
and that means using different software to be able to figure out what's best for your project.
I've worked in smart sheets before and I've also worked in Asana, and there are plenty
of other software, plenty of other software available out there for project management,
so I really like that you can find the specific one that caters to your particular project.
What I dislike about new project management methodologies is that there are so many
options and I think that you can get really sucked into figuring out and
trying to figure out the different software to see where it lines up for your project.
And I think that can start to distract from actually getting in there and doing it, so
it's a love-and-hate relationship with some of the new parts of project management that are 
evolving.
Well, something that I like is the technology.
Something that I dislike is the learning curve
that's required to adapt and understand the new technology.
And in addition, I do enjoy the opportunity to manage projects in a virtual environment,
but I also understand the challenges that come along with a virtual project
and the need to really communicate well in that particular environment.

Module 2 Summary: Working as a Project 
Manager
Potential stakeholders on a project include team members, executives, clients, and various other 
departments such as legal, sales, IT, operations, and HR in an organization.
•	Project managers build and maintain positive working relationships with stakeholders by 
effectively identifying, analyzing, and proactively engaging with stakeholders from 
beginning to end.
•	By working across teams, functions, and departments, project managers can align their goals 
with the project's objectives. This allows the project team to adjust the project in response to 
changes and new developments.
•	Waterfall, critical path, and critical chain methodologies use a linear, structured approach in 
which tasks take place in either mutually exclusive phases or sequences. Agile is focused on 
iterative development and constant improvement. Lean is focused on continual production 
flow, and Six Sigma is data-focused and manufacturing-driven.
•	Recent trends in project management include the use of artificial intelligence, project 
management software, data analytics, remote teams, and a global workforce, hybrid project 
management methodologies, and an emphasis on soft skills.
•	The advantages of traditional project management over modern project management are that 
it is predictable and stable. The advantages of modern project management are that it is 
flexible, responsive, and automated.

Expert Viewpoints: Traits of a Project 
Manager

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Traits of a Project Manager.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing the most important traits for project
managers to have and what kind of people are a good fit for the project manager role.
I highly suggest somebody that is very detail oriented.
You're going to have a very professional standpoint in the overall project.
Again, you're leading and responsible for the overall project and may be working with
a lot of C-suite individuals for your stakeholders.
Along with that, organization is the biggest thing that you will need.
Highly suggest that you are very organized and if you don't know, go try to find out
ways to be organized.
Along with that time management, you will need that for the overall success of the project,
including the schedule even the budget can be impacted and the scope, of course.
For me, at the very top of the list is diplomacy.
A project manager is, if they're good, is a consummate diplomat.
You have the ability to work with teams in a way that motivates them, keeps them happy.
You know, I like my teams to have fun.
I think a good trait of a project manager to have is empathy.
I think as a project manager you're working with typically multiple stakeholders from
executive sponsors to other functions like marketing, HR, finance, really,
so many different people, as well as your team, and each of those people is a unique
individual with unique skill set.
And if you're a project manager, you need to have empathy and be able to understand
the different motivations of each of your stakeholders and really connect with those
people on a level that they can appreciate
and that allows them to work well with you.
The most important traits for project managers to have are communication and people skills.
Communication because of the fact that project managers work across several different stakeholders
in different departments.
So it's really important to stay on top of each of those stakeholders and their milestones
and be able to know when is the right time to communicate with them and how to do so,
and at the same time be able to have the people skills and the relationship skills to remember
that while
we are working on a project that, ultimately, every person involved is a person and because
of that, they're going to have different things that are affecting their work.
So while staying on top of everything is really important, it's also really important to value
the people around you and be able to be a part of the culture that keeps a positive
work environment for everyone involved.
And that ultimately has led to in my experience and I think most people's experience is successful
launches of projects.
I'm going to respond with three traits.
Number 1, ensure that you are a good organizer.
Number 2, ensure that you are proactive and number 3, ensure that you are a good communicator.
In terms of organization, understand the appropriate project life cycle that will support
the project best and implement it in terms of being proactive issues and changes in a
project are going to occur in many cases.
As a project manager, those issues and changes will not come to you.
You could very well be the last to know.
So you need to proactively go out and find them before they do find you.
And third communication, it is said by the Project Management Institute that effective
communication is 90% of a project manager's job.
I am a firm believer in that percentage, and could probably argue the point that it's in
all likelihood closer to 100.
What kind of people are a good fit for a project manager role?
The kind of people that are a good fit for project manager roles are people that are
able to balance several different things at once.
Because while I mentioned communication and people skills are really important, so is
balance because you're continuously juggling different pieces of a puzzle.
So people who are able to do that are the best fit.
I've met a wide variety of project managers, but the best people have always been people.
They're, they're people who enjoy working with their teams.
They're personable.
They are easy to, like, they really care both for the work and the people around them.
And, to me, that's the most, most important thing.
You know, all the other skills can be learned, but if you don't have that, that caring
attitude, it's very hard to keep a team happy and working well out.
I think that anyone that is fairly organized, that's detail-oriented, that can break down
kind of a complex situation into bite-sized pieces.
And then string those pieces together so that they make sense could be a good project manager.
I think people that have strong people skills can be project managers.
I think people who are good at admin tasks can be good project managers.
I think that there's lots of people that could be a good fit for project management.
Simple answer, enjoy two things.
Number one, be organized and enjoy the process.
There's a distinct project process that is required to effectively manage a project.
Secondly, ensure that you enjoy interfacing with people.
A good project manager is a good communicator and builds relationships with all stakeholders
and the team.

Soft Skills for Project Management
Welcome to "Soft skills for project management."
After watching this video, you will be able to
explain the term soft skills,
and describe the soft skills required for effective project management.
While other parts of this course focus on the technical skills required for project management
-for instance, proficiency in spreadsheet software-
this video emphasizes the importance of soft skills.
Soft skills include intangible skills such as personality traits,
interpersonal skills, and attitudes cultivated from your life experiences.
They are not as readily quantifiable, taught, and learned as technical skills.
The soft skills that are helpful for project managers will be discussed in this video.
This video organizes soft skills into four categories:
Proficiencies
Competencies
Traits
Mindsets
We will discuss examples from each category that are helpful for a project manager's success.
Proficiencies describe expertise in a particular
area and the ability to utilize this knowledge effectively.
There are a number of these proficiencies required to be a successful project manager.
This includes skills in research, analysis, negotiation, and report writing:
Research enables project managers to find accurate
information within or outside of the organization quickly.
Analysis allows project managers to take the information they've gathered,
evaluate, and interpret it, then make decisions based on that information.
Negotiation skills provide the ability to get two or
more parties with different points of view to come to an agreement.
Project managers should be proficient in report writing to create effective reports,
tailored to a specific audience, which are well-organized and accessible.
Competencies are areas of expertise for which you have sufficient knowledge to perform.
For project managers, relevant competencies include written and oral communication,
time management, public speaking, decision-making, and relationship-building.
Though most modern professional jobs require communication skills,
project managers in particular must be effective written and verbal communicators,
as they are responsible for communicating with, between, and two different stakeholders.
Effective time management is necessary for project managers.
They are responsible for planning projects, and time management is a crucial part of that.
They should be able to accurately estimate how long a task will take,
effectively stay on the task themselves, and help their team manage their time.
Project managers must be comfortable speaking
publicly to direct meetings and deliver presentations.
Using their research and analysis skills, project managers should be able to make
decisions based on relevant information by identifying and assessing alternatives.
Project managers are responsible for building relationships among stakeholders.
These strong relationships are based on trust, communication, respect, and inclusion.
Traits are aspects of your personality. Traits
can be developed and improved with attention and practice.
Some traits necessary for project managers are being self-motivated,
creative, detail-oriented, and able to task-switch.
If project managers are motivated, they can better persuade and motivate others effectively.
They can guide themselves and their team members through the
ups and downs of project development and stay motivated to stay on task with their work.
Project managers may find themselves in situations where they must devise
creative and unconventional solutions to problems.
Being curious, seeking out new connections,
and keeping an open mind are ways to become more creative.
Projects are comprised of lots of small, moving parts.
Project managers should be able to keep an eye on all
these small parts without losing track of them;
spreadsheets, project tracking software, and detailed plans help a project manager identify,
manage, and keep track of a project's many details.
To task-switch, project managers should be able to switch between tasks rapidly and efficiently.
Project managers must keep track of numerous tasks simultaneously
and go back and forth between projects frequently and quickly.
They need to task-switch without taking time to
re-orient themselves among the tasks they are responsible for.
Mindsets describe an overall mental attitude.
They guide how project managers approach their work.
The main mindsets required of project managers are characterized by leadership,
goal orientation, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving.
Project managers should remember that they are leaders and responsible for
the growth and success of their team members.
By setting achievable, measurable goals,
project managers set themselves and their teams up for success.
Project managers should be able to bring a critical lens
to their project planning and managing activities.
This will help them find effective solutions to problems as they arise.
Project managers must always be conscientious of their teammates and other stakeholders.
They should approach problems and tasks with an attitude of cooperation.
A problem-solving mindset requires project managers to approach problems by identifying
their causes, coming up with possible solutions, and then applying the most appropriate one.
In this video, you learned that project management requires many soft skills, including:
Proficiencies in research, analysis, negotiation, report writing, and presentation.
Competencies such as written and oral communication, time management,
public speaking, decision-making, and building effective relationships.
Traits such as self-motivation, creativity, detail orientation, and task-switching.
Mindsets characterized by leadership,
goal orientation, critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving.

Technical Skills for Project Management

Welcome to "Technical skills for project management."
After watching this video, you will be able to list and describe the technical skills
and competencies required for project management.
While soft skills are becoming increasingly important in project management, successful
project managers must also have several technical skills,
sometimes known as hard skills.
Organizations expect project managers to have technical skills in three areas:
Project management methodologies and processes,
Business administration and management,
Software and information technology.
Technical skills in project management involve managing all aspects of a project's life cycle.
This means that project managers must understand the different phases of the project life cycle
and be familiar with project management
methodologies such as waterfall, agile, Kanban, PMBOK, and Lean.
Project managers must also understand the role that cost, time, and resource constraints
play in each project.
Project managers use this knowledge of project management methodologies to execute the project
planning process.
This is when they will define a project's scope and goals, develop strategies for directing
their teams, and determine how to complete project deliverables within the agreed cost,
time, and resource budgets.
A project manager's main role involves project execution.
To successfully execute a project, project managers will need to be able to conduct risk
assessments and take appropriate action to mitigate identified risks,
which may include working with compliance to understand legal and regulatory risks.
They must be able to track and monitor project status, identify blockers, and escalate issues
to appropriate stakeholders
Project managers must also ensure that teams are complying with relevant business processes
and policies, such as Standard Operating Procedures, also called SOPs, and compliance control 
processes.
Successful execution of a project will also require that project managers be comfortable
with common business administration practices.
Project managers should have a familiarity with:
Identifying business needs and determining solutions to business problems,
Developing project budgets and monitoring project spending,
Determining, tracking, and reporting key performance indicators to ensure projects meet the defined
objectives within agreed-upon cost, time, and resource budgets.
Since project managers work directly with teams and stakeholders to plan and execute
projects,
they should also have strong skills in resource planning, business process improvement, and
change management.
Project managers are often responsible for allocating tasks to team members based on
capacity and skill sets and maximizing team efficiency by managing utilization rates and
monitoring progress.
They may also need to identify, analyze, and improve existing business processes, particularly
processes that teams can reuse between many projects.
At times, project managers may also need to implement strategies that effect change and
help teams adapt to changes, such as transformation of an organization's goals, processes, or
technologies.
Project managers must have technical skills in software and information technology.
Project managers use software to plan, track, and monitor projects, as well as collaborate
with team members and stakeholders.
Software that project managers are frequently expected to be familiar with include:
Collaboration tools such as Slack, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams,
Productivity suites that include spreadsheets, email, calendar, and word processing programs
such as such as Microsoft Office and Google Workspace,
Project management tools such as Asana, ZenHub, Jira, GitHub, and Trello.
Project managers may also benefit from data management skills and a working knowledge
of cloud technologies.
Data management involves understanding basic database structures such as relational databases
and organizing and modifying data.
Project managers may use data to understand market trends, and user needs, as well as
visualizing key performance indicators or product testing data.
Project managers may also need to use software and tools within a cloud environment, so they
should be aware of various cloud technologies and services.
Data analysis and reporting tools include IBM Cognos, Salesforce Tableau, and Google
Looker.
If you are interested in being an IT project manager, organizations may require additional
specialized skills.
Common skills needed for IT project managers include:
Knowledge of the Software Development Life Cycle, also known as the SDLC,
Knowledge of Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, also called OOAD,
which breaks applications into objects and develops requirements and designs around objects
and their relationships.
Experience with agile and waterfall project management and development methodologies.
Knowledge of the practices, tools, and philosophies critical to DevOps, which brings software
development and IT operations together to reduce software time to market.
Some familiarity with programming languages such as Python, C sharp, Java, JavaScript,
or CSS, which can be useful for communication with development teams.
Additional skills are often required for IT project managers who manage IT projects including:
Incident management to respond to unexpected interruptions and restoration of services.
Monitoring, managing and optimizing an organization's information technology systems.
Quality management to ensure the quality and consistency of a product or service using
QA processes and software testing methodologies.
Information systems security and security standards to ensure the safety of information
system assets.
IT fundamentals such as hardware, operating systems, software & applications, networking,
storage, cybersecurity and cloud and the technology landscape related to the product
area they operate in.
In this video, you learned that
There are many technical skills that may be expected of a project manager.
These largely fall into several categories.
Project management methodologies and processes such as project lifecycles and executing project
planning processes.
Business administration and management such as budgeting and KPIs.
Software and information technology such as collaboration tools, productivity suites and
project management tools.
Additional skills required for IT project managers include incident management, monitoring,
quality management, and cybersecurity.


Expert Viewpoints: Necessary Project 
Management Skills

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Necessary Project Management Skills.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing the
skills needed to become a successful project manager.
They have to have the ability to listen well.
They need to know how to deal with people in a way that can keep them happy,
keep them motivated, but also keep them honest, you know,
make sure that the work is truly getting done.
Besides that, you know, it can depend.
you can be a great project manager, with, you know, tremendous technical skills,
you know, you could come from being a coder,
or you can just be extremely good at learning.
To be successful as a project manager, you need several different skills.
It's not just about knowing who is who in the company within the cross-functional teams.
That is great to know.
You also need to know a little bit about the product or service that
you are implementing or trying to complete for the overall project.
You should also have negotiation skills.
Sometimes you're going to need resources at certain hours,
and it might not work for you because they're working on another project.
You need to be able to persuade in order to get that person to work
additional hours with your project versus another one because it's more important.
I think project managers also need to have some level of computer skills and technology skills,
especially if they want to get into the IT industry or become, you know,
a project manager for a company that deals primarily in technology.
I think you know a basic understanding of some of the tools like word processing,
presentation software, and spreadsheet software are critical.
You'll be doing a lot of as a project manager.
You'll be doing a lot of writing, documentation, and creating presentations.
Looking at data and using spreadsheets for that.
The skills needed to become a successful project manager are problem solving because
there are going to be problems that come up with different milestones,
for people on a project, external/internal stakeholders' problems are going to come up.
So being able to think on your feet pretty quickly and problem-solve is very important.
And at that same token, being creative, being creative in those problem-solving
skills is extremely important because there's not always going to be a process
written out for how to identify the problems and how to get solutions.
So to be able to creatively think about something creatively,
collaborate with your team, and figuring out solutions will be really important.
So, problem solving and creativity.
To be honest, I could probably talk for hours on this particular subject,
but I'm going to narrow it down to three key skills.
Skill number one: effective communication.
Learn as much about effective communications as you can.
If you have an opportunity to communicate,
take that opportunity, no matter how uncomfortable it may be.
The better you communicate, the more successful your potential is to become a project manager.
Secondly, understand situational leadership.
Everyone is different.
A good project manager leads situationally.
They analyze the audience, they analyze the stakeholders,
and they adjust their leadership style to go ahead and meet the needs and, hopefully,
meet the needs to motivate and commit the individuals that you are leading.
Third: build trust.
Trust is a common denominator that is required before any
project team can actually become a team.
Share information, be vulnerable and encourage others to be vulnerable as well.
If you can establish a trusting relationship with stakeholders
and the team, then the project will, in all likelihood, go very, very far.

Interpersonal Skills and Leadership in Project 
Management
Welcome to "Interpersonal skills and leadership in project management."
After watching this video, you will be able to
describe the need for interpersonal and leadership skills when managing a project,
list leadership skills that are crucial to project management, and
interpersonal skills and leadership are invaluable skills for project managers.
Project managers are not only managers but leaders for their teams.
In addition to managing many aspects of a project,
they are also responsible for leading a group of different team members and stakeholders,
often with varying backgrounds, experiences, and opinions.
Project leadership brings together team members in order to work towards a common goal.
There is no rule book or set steps to becoming a leader,
and many personality types can effectively lead a team.
Leadership and management are similar skills with plenty of overlap,
but they also have distinctions.
Management involves methodically planning, organizing, and coordinating tasks and resources.
This could include budgeting, creating schedules, and working with outside contractors.
On the other hand, leadership involves motivating and encouraging others.
Leadership is not about controlling team members but more about enabling them to do their best.
Project managers must be both managers and leaders.
They need to not only manage details but also often need to inspire a team
and communicate a guiding vision for everyone to work towards.
Being a leader involves a wide range of interpersonal skills.
These skills include
communication,
team building,
motivation,
trust building, and
conflict management.
We will discuss examples of each category that are helpful for a project manager's success.
Project managers should be able to effectively communicate with their team members.
Communication not only includes the ability to speak and persuade but
the ability to ask the right questions and listen.
Project managers should also be able to facilitate effective communication between
individual team members and groups such as different departments in an organization.
Project managers should be able to build teams across the organization.
Because project teams often involve people from across departments,
project managers must bring these people together to achieve a common goal even
if they have different interests in the project.
Project managers can use their knowledge of a teams' skills, personality traits,
and interests to not only form teams but also to foster team relationships.
Project managers should be able to motivate the team and stakeholders.
Project managers must be able to maintain morale,
encourage team members to do their best, and keep them interested in their work on the project.
Project managers must understand the needs and motivators of each team member and stakeholder
on the project and use that knowledge to help the team meet the objectives of
the project and be satisfied with the work they are accomplishing.
Project managers should be able to build trust in the team.
Project managers should foster an environment of
trust between the team members and stakeholders involved in a project.
Trust is an important element of project success and can lead to more effective communication,
increased productivity, and decreased risk.
Project managers can build trust by following through
on their commitments and creating an environment where team members
feel comfortable discussing project blockers and giving honest feedback.
Project managers should be able to manage conflict.
Given the diversity of most project teams, conflict is often unavoidable.
Project managers can avoid some conflict by clearly defining project objectives,
roles, and responsibilities from the beginning of the project.
When conflict does arise, they can use a number
of conflict resolution strategies to mitigate the impact of the conflict.
There are usually five steps to conflict resolution:
acknowledgment, clarification, mediation, solution identification, and monitoring.
Let's look at an application of this strategy in practice next.
For example, say Marty is new to a project that Gene has been working on for weeks.
Marty needs guidance from Gene, but Gene is up against a tight deadline.
Consequently, they both feel frustrated with each
other because Gene doesn't feel like Marty is doing her share of the work,
and Marty feels discouraged because she doesn't know how to get started.
The first step is acknowledgment.
As the project manager, you let them know you recognize the issue.
Next, you clarify.
You ensure they know you are aware of the problem.
Third, you mediate by discussing the issue with both of them.
Then, as the solution, you find another resource to help reduce Gene's workload
and confirm with Gene that he now has the bandwidth to assist Marty,
and you let Marty know Gene has been under a tight
deadline but you have found someone else to assist with some administrative tasks.
Gene and Marty now have some time to work together.
For the last step, follow-up,
you check in later to ensure that Marty gets the training from Gene she needs.
In this video, you learned that interpersonal and leadership skills help project managers to:
Work more effectively with team members and stakeholders.
In addition to the managerial skills that help project managers work with budgets,
resources, and schedules, leadership skills help
project managers inspire a team to work towards a shared vision.
Some of the interpersonal skills needed for leadership in project management include
communication, team building, motivation, trust building, and conflict management.
There is no single best way to utilize these skills, and project managers
benefit from having a variety of styles that they can draw on to lead a project.


Transferable Project Management Skills
Project management and similar skills found 
in other careers
Project managers oversee all aspects of a project, from start to finish. They manage the budget and 
resources, organize the team, and provide feedback at every process stage. They ensure deadlines 
are met and the final product is of high quality. Being a project manager comes with tremendous 
pressure because a project manager is responsible for the success and failure of a project. The best 
project managers should possess the soft and technical skills to address the responsibilities 
associated with their position.
Many of these skills and characteristics are transferrable from other jobs. By the time you finish 
reading this article, you will know how to compare positions that overlap with project management 
and which roles could easily transfer into project management.
Roles with skills that transfer to project management
•	A data analyst may be good with organization and math; both are vital skills for project 
managers because they need to keep an organized schedule to keep the project on plan and 
budget their allocated resources to stay within their quota.
•	A project coordinator is like a project manager; it is common to find a project coordinator 
assisting a project manager in their projects. Both roles involve coordinating, organizing, 
writing documentation, and having the ability to manage time wisely.
•	A technical writer is someone who writes content about technical subjects. Like project 
managers, they must be good with grammar, writing documentation, analyzing, and 
researching because these skills are also used in many everyday tasks of a project manager.
•	A contract manager is a professional who handles a company's legal documents and 
contracts. They weigh the pros and cons of new contracts and negotiate to ensure their 
company gets everything they need to get the job done. Contract managers must be good at 
negotiation and risk management. Project managers must also be able to weigh the pros and 
cons of different budget and resource strategies and negotiate with stakeholders to come to 
the best possible outcome for the entire group. Project managers must also be able to 
manage risk.
•	A budget analyst must think critically and be able to analyze data to solve a problem or find 
an answer. A budget analyst's role typically includes reviewing budgets and providing 
guidance on how to manage the company's budget. Project managers must also think 
critically and look at all factors to determine the appropriate course of action. Some project 
managers will also handle project budgets, so they must be able to look at the budget and 
determine how to move forward. For example, if materials for the project are more 
expensive than originally planned, they may need to find another vendor, renegotiate a 
contract, or reallocate budget resources.
•	An event planner must take many moving pieces and align them to ensure an event goes 
smoothly. They have to consider the stakeholder's budget, the scheduling of events, and 
ensure everyone and everything coordinates. Event planners make great project managers 
because events are very similar to projects.
•	A quality control inspector monitors the standards of manufactured products. They must be 
meticulous in catching any product mistakes before leaving the facility. They must also be 
good at documentation to improve quality control with each new batch of products. A 
project manager must be equally meticulous to ensure catching mistakes in a project before 
sending it to a client or going live. Project managers are also responsible for documenting 
processes to ensure continuous improvement.
Skills that transfer to project management
As you have seen, other careers with skills that transfer well to project management include event 
planners, technical writers, data analysts, and operations managers. But many soft and technical 
skills found in other positions also transfer well to project management, such as
•	time management
•	written communication
•	verbal communication
•	budgeting
•	foundational computer skills
•	time management
•	leadership
Therefore, many other roles can provide you with skills you can apply in a project management 
role. So long as you possess (or are willing to learn) the soft and technical skills to address the day-
to-day tasks and responsibilities associated with a project management role, you can be a successful 
project manager.
Project Manager Responsibilities
Welcome to "Project manager responsibilities."
After watching this video, you will be able to
list the responsibilities of a project manager, and
describe the responsibilities of a project manager.
Project managers have several responsibilities throughout the lifecycle of a project.
A responsibility is something that the project manager is
accountable for that is within their control.
Project managers are responsible for:
project planning, project execution,
project monitoring and reporting, post-project evaluation and
project closing.
Project managers fulfill these responsibilities by completing
a number of tasks before, during, and after a project.
Tasks are definable pieces of work that are assigned to or expected of the project manager.
One of the primary responsibilities of a project manager is project planning,
which begins as soon as the project initiates.
Project managers are responsible for making sure that project goals and deliverables
have been determined and that there is a plan in place to meet those objectives.
During the planning phase, project managers:
Build a project overview or business case to define project objectives,
and identify key performance indicators or success metrics for the project
Estimate the time and effort required to complete a project and create a project plan,
Kanban board, or Gantt chart that clarifies the project plan and schedule
Project managers develop a project budget.
They must create a financial plan that outlines the anticipated usage of project resources.
This budget includes costs, profits, expenditures, and sources of funding.
Project plans and budgets can be created for the
entire project (such as in a waterfall or hybrid project management model),
or they can be created for a small, definable portion of the project (as in the case of agile).
Once a project plan is in place, the project manager is responsible for the execution of
the project and making sure that team members deliver on project objectives.
To do this, project managers must create, disperse, and maintain:
An accountability matrix to help team members
understand their individual roles and responsibilities as well as,
resource and utilization plans that guide the management of project resources,
and a risk assessment and issue management tracker to facilitate risk and issue management.
During the project, project managers are also responsible
for monitoring and reporting on the project's development.
They must monitor the project's execution compared to time, cost,
and resource plans created during the planning phase.
Communication is also a key responsibility of project managers, and they must ensure that
stakeholders receive regular reports regarding the status of the project.
The project manager must determine who needs to receive what specific information,
when they will receive it, and what communication channels will be used.
To facilitate monitoring, reporting, and communication, project managers may:
Build project dashboards to monitor the status of projects,
track risks and issues and then communicate project status with all stakeholders.
Project managers may also facilitate regular meetings with stakeholders,
keeping detailed agendas and notes to discuss the status of the project.
They also need to track resources and costs and may need to participate in a timesheet,
invoice, or expense approval.
These responsibilities require project managers to keep track
of several details about team members and stakeholders, as well as the project itself.
There are several project management, communication,
and collaboration tools that can assist project managers with these tasks and responsibilities.
Finally, project managers are also responsible for the evaluation and closing of a project.
They must be able to critically assess a project's performance, whether the project
met its defined goals and objectives, and how the team may improve the process in the future.
After evaluating the project, they must ensure that all project deliverables and
information are finalized, stored, and dispersed for future use.
Project managers may review project deliverables and evaluate key performance indicators, or 
KPIs,
which provide quantifiable measures of performance.
These indicators help project managers evaluate
the efficiency and effectiveness of a project's performance and delivery.
Using this data, they can identify strengths and
weaknesses in the project process and target areas for improvement.
This stage is also an opportunity to highlight
what went well and reward team members for strong performances.
Project managers may also create a post-project report or hold a
retrospective, where they document key project learnings and possible process improvements.
They may also ensure that all project deliverables are packaged,
and project information is archived and readily available for future use if needed.
In this video, you learned that
A project manager's responsibilities include
project planning, execution, monitoring, reporting, evaluation, and closing a project.
Project planning and execution is the initial
phase that establishes a project's goals, deliverables, and schedule.
While monitoring and reporting,
project managers assess and communicate project status to all stakeholders.
And evaluation and closing involve assessment of the project's effectiveness after its completion,
packaging project deliverables, and archiving project information.


A Day in the Life of a Project Manager
Welcome to "A Day in the Life of a Project Manager."
Hi, I'm Nery, and I work as a project manager for a large enterprise in Seattle.
When I arrive at work in the morning, I spend some time reviewing my email
I receive overnight and review messages on Slack, our team communication tool.
I also take a quick look at my calendar to see what meetings I have for the day.
We just finished the design phase of our project and began the implementation phase.
I need to check in with the development lead
to ensure her team is ready to start this stage of the project.
Later in the day, I'm running our weekly project status meeting with our stakeholders.
I spend a few minutes creating some agenda notes for our status meeting,
and I make a copy of our meeting note templates for both the standup and our status meeting.
Before the status meeting, I review our project
plan and task tracker to see what tasks are currently in progress.
I want to ensure that the team has all the resources they need
for the implementation phase of the project.
I also review our risk assessment and issue log to make sure I'm prepared to
address any blocking issues that the team may bring up during our status meeting.
Next, I meet with the development lead.
We discuss the makeup of the team and who is assigned to
deliver the various pieces of the project.
She informs me that they're down a person due to infant
care leave and won't be able to meet the scheduled dates without a replacement.
We discuss a few strategies and schedule options that
we can bring to the team at the status meeting later in the day.
I also commit to discussing the matter with our manager.
After my meeting, I review the project schedule and begin planning for the next phases.
Implementation is planned to take three months, which brings us up
against a corporate holiday and a time of the year when many people take time off.
I built that into the schedule already, but design took longer than we planned,
so I make a few adjustments to accommodate the delay.
I send an email to all the project leads to let
them know of the adjustment and to inform their teams.
I plan on reinforcing this schedule update during the upcoming status meeting.
After a meeting with my manager, it's time for lunch.
I have lunch with another project manager, Mette, who is getting ready to kick off another project.
We talk about how the project will be resourced and realize that her project
will require some of the same resources that currently are on my project.
We discuss the timelines for both our projects and confirm there will be overlap.
We spend some time discussing how we can
accommodate both projects using the resources across the teams.
We agree that we need to raise this situation with our manager, so he's aware.
Mette also lets me know that she's been told the vendor budget might be expanded next year.
We discuss the impact of this, and she suggests that it is one
way we might be able to address our problem with overlapping resources.
Next, I have a meeting with my program manager to inform him of the status of the project.
We talk about the previous phase, the design phase, and how that went.
We talk about the outcome of that phase and how it will impact implementation.
I tell him that we are down a designer and a developer and that we could use some vendor
budget so we can hire temporary employees to fill in for the gaps.
I also inform him of the schedule update,
and he tells me that I need to pull my dates in a few days.
We talk about options for doing this and decide that if he's able to get the vendor budget,
we may be able to bring the schedule in a couple of days.
We decided to table the discussion until he explores the vendor budget question.
During the design phase, I offered to help the design
manager transcribe videos from a previous project.
By doing this work, it helps me stayed plugged
into the team and better understand the work they do on a daily basis.
After lunch, I spend an hour on this project and then inform the design manager of my progress.
I then have a meeting with the test manager and the development manager
to discuss a conflict between two of their direct reports.
The tester and the developer disagree about how much tolerance to allow on an error condition.
The developer believes there should be more room for the condition to trigger,
and the tester wants the numbers to be tighter.
Both managers agree that there isn't a clear answer on which position to prefer,
but the test manager agrees to take the developer's position and take
point in communicating that message to both teams.
During the project status meeting, I share updates
with the project stakeholders and answer any concerns that the stakeholders have.
We invited a member of our leadership to join the
status meeting as she had some information to share.
Our leadership is happy with the progress that we've made in the design phase,
but lets the team know that there is a new requirement
for the product based on some compliance and policy changes.
We discuss the new requirement and address potential impacts to the overall timeline.
We end the meeting by reviewing the plan for the following week
and determining agenda items for the next meeting.
I spend the rest of my afternoon answering emails, checking Slack for any new messages,
and updating our schedule based on the conversations I had today.
I also create a few new scheduling models to
test some other ideas in case the published version doesn't work.
I also work on an executive summary of the current
status of the project and archive files on our file share from the design phase.
Before I know it, it's time to head home.

Expert Viewpoints: A Day in the Life of a 
Project Manager

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: A Day in the Life of a Project Manager.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing a
typical day working as a project manager.
Let me introduce a new concept.
If you've never heard of it before, it's called WBS, the work breakdown structure.
A work breakdown structure is a hierarchical breakout of all of the different tasks that
are required, hopefully in the order in which they need to occur.
A good project manager will create a work breakdown structure,
and that particular work breakdown structure will guide his and her every day.
You take a look at what has been accomplished.
You take a look at what is in progress.
You take a look at what is planned, and you plan accordingly.
I love to start my day out with a cup of coffee and just
read through my emails to see what is needed.
Any big tasks that are added or any updates for projects from there I typically have about
3 to 4 technical meetings and they could be a configuration call or a design call for example.
Then I also have about two to three PM syncs and with those PM syncs, let's just check
in with our stakeholders to let them know updates and give them the weekly reports,
and then from there, I love to make sure that all my accounts
are updated with the weekly notes or just what happened throughout that day,
and then, I will go ahead and close out my day.
Since I'm running a lot of agile projects over the last years
very much the day starts with standups.
My last project, I was managing four different projects at one point,
so that meant four different virtual standups.
You using Zoom every morning after that,
it's really a matter of keeping organized, you know, using whatever tools you have.
We've been using Jira most recently for organizing and keeping track of all the tasks.
Then within Outlook, I use you know, tasks to keep track of everything I need to do.
Early in the morning, it's reviewing all the emails,
responding, and making sure nothing new has come.
And then throughout the day, checking with the team, uh, slowly going through and figuring out
who needs assistance, what can I do to empower them to do their job well?
And then throughout the rest of the day,
it's really a matter of working on all the various tasks. There may be documentation.
There may be budgeting. There may be people that need to be hired or found even.
A typical day in my job will always start with me
taking a look at our milestone calendars to see which date is
coming up the soonest, and depending on where we are
on the calendar and how that milestone is doing,
that'll base how the rest of my day is going to go.
So if we are approaching a milestone date and I haven't heard from that stakeholder
about the progress for that particular milestone, then I'll check in with them,
see where we're at, and if there's an obstacle in making sure that milestone is completed.
Then I'll contact that stakeholder, see how we need to mitigate the issue, whether we
have to meet or gather other stakeholders and figure out a Plan B, then there's,
What do I do next?
and then I also typically start to plan for the next phase depending on how much
problem-solving is involved at the beginning of the day, then during the end of the day,
I'll start to take a look through what's coming up
next and identify pieces of that project from there.
What items do you only do once or twice in a project?
The Project Charter. A project charter is a document that should be created once.
It's very, very high level, and the purpose of a
project charter is to describe what the project is, why it's important,
and who needs to be involved, according to the Project Management Institute.
A project charter rarely changes everything that you will do.
It's going to be based on that particular project charter in terms of planning,
execution, control, and closure.
Typically, I will only do a kickoff call once at the beginning of the project.
Otherwise, we might do it again if we have a different team that is taking over for
a different part of the project, like a new product, for example.
Typically, we also only review the project once, so you should have a
very good understanding at the beginning of what is needed and what the scope is.
You can, of course, reference back to the scope.
However, doing that true, thorough review of the
scope of the project should only really be done once.
And then transition the project over to our support team, for example,
or another team if anything else is needed.
You know, something that's not really routine,
that happens every once in a while, is you might have a conflict between two
team members that you need to resolve, and you need as a project manager.
You work to facilitate getting those challenges and those issues resolved.
I think that occasionally on a project, you'll have a time where you miss a deadline,
or a big issue comes up, or a risk that you've tried to mitigate actually happens.
And then you have to spend time working through those risks and mitigating those issues.

Module 3 Summary: What does being a 
project manager require?

Soft skills are more intangible than technical skills and may include qualities such as personality or 
attitude. Soft skills are not as readily quantifiable or able to be taught as technical skills, but they 
can be developed and improved.
•	Useful technical skills for project managers include project management methodologies and 
processes, business administration and management, and software and information 
technology. 
•	Useful soft skills for project managers include research, analysis, written and oral 
communication, time management, decision-making, self-motivation, task-switching, and 
problem-solving. 
•	Interpersonal and leadership skills allow project managers to work more effectively with 
team members and stakeholders. Skills such as communication, team building, and conflict 
management help project managers inspire a team to work towards a shared vision. 
•	Project managers are responsible for project planning, execution, monitoring and reporting, 
post-project evaluation, and project closing. Project managers fulfill these responsibilities by 
performing tasks such as budgeting, assessing risk, evaluating key performance indicators, 
and many more.
•	A typical day in the life of a project manager usually involves communications and 
calendars. They often attend a daily standup meeting and other meetings such as a sprint 
review, sprint retrospective, or project status meetings. 
•	Many soft and technical skills found in other positions such as time management, writing 
well, good verbal communication, and leadership transfer well to project management.
Careers in Project Management Overview

Welcome to "Careers in Project Management."
After watching this video, you will be able to
list possible positions for project managers from the entry-level to senior level,
their responsibilities, and average salaries, and
describe the projected growth in project management-oriented employment
Industries are changing.
Rather than role-based, they are increasingly becoming project-based.
Industries are finding that a project-based approach leads to innovation and allows more
efficient operations, readily responding to increases or decreases in demand.
Ultimately, this means there is a greater need for project management across most industries.
Depending on knowledge and experience, project managers can find roles at all
levels of an organization including entry level, mid-level, and executive levels.
Entry-level project management positions include
Assistant Project Manager or Project Coordinator roles.
Assistant project managers and project coordinators are similar roles.
Other similar roles are called project associate or associate project manager.
They support project managers in various administrative and technical tasks.
These positions can expect to schedule meetings,
update reports, and identify resource requirements.
These roles require very little, to no, project-management experience.
Entry-level project managers can expect to make an average of $55 to $65,000 a year.
With some experience, there are many mid-career-level jobs for project managers.
These positions might include being a Project Manager, a Scrum Master, or a Project Team Lead.
In some organizations, a project manager can be called a project officer or project engineer.
A mid-level project manager tends to take on a leadership role with regard to the project team
and makes an average salary of about $78,000 a year and Scrum masters specialize in Scrum,
a framework for product development, and they help teams plan and meet their goals.
They take on a facilitator role rather than a leadership one.
They earn an average of $97,000 a year.
Project team leads have expertise in the field in which they are leading the team.
They specialize in motivating a team, managing conflict,
and understanding the strengths and synergies of team members.
They make an average of $81,000 a year.
Mid-level roles typically require some project management experience, a degree in a relevant
field such as business administration, and/or a project management certification.
Project managers can also find roles at the executive level.
Positions at the executive level may include Senior
Project Manager or Director of Project Management.
A senior project manager typically has at least ten years of experience
supervising projects, planning strategies, and leading teams.
They develop project plans, host project meetings, and coordinate vendor and supplier resourcing.
The average salary of a senior project manager is $97,000.
A director of project management is usually the highest position in project management.
A director of project management provides strategic directions for a company's
projects by defining how those projects fit into the business's strategy and goals.
The average salary of a director of project management is $146,000.
Project management is a rapidly growing field.
According to the Project Management Institute, or PMI, the global economy will require 2.3
million new project professionals every year to close the talent gap by 2030.
A recent survey by the PMI revealed that project management was one of
the top-five areas that business leaders sought to prioritize.
The growth rate of project management-oriented employment is expected to be higher than
overall employment in industries that are becoming increasingly project-oriented.
This includes industries such as information and publishing,
finance and insurance, and manufacturing and construction.
According to an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the greatest
project management-oriented employment growth is expected to take place in software 
development.
In this video, you learned that:
Possible positions in project management include working as an assistant project
manager, project coordinator, project manager, scrum master,
project team lead, senior project manager, or director of program management.
Project management is a growing field, and many more jobs open up every year.
Project management-oriented employment is lucrative,
particularly as entire industries become more and more project-oriented.

Project Management Across Industries
Welcome to "Project Management across Industries."
After watching this video, you will be able to
explain the importance of Project Management in various industries, and
describe what a Project Manager requires to succeed in an industry.
Some of the industries that usually require project management professionals include:
Construction
Engineering
Information technology
Finance
Healthcare
Manufacturing
Let's first try to understand the importance of project managers in the construction industry.
Despite the increase in demand, concerns like rising prices and
regulations make it difficult to make profits in this industry.
This is where project managers become valuable.
For various projects such as residential buildings, commercial properties,
or industrial facilities, project managers need to effectively coordinate with multiple stakeholders
and resources such as architects,
engineers, city planners, public work employees, and construction crews.
Project manager involvement keeps the construction
of buildings and facilities on track, from budgeting and schedule development
to managing day-to-day activities throughout the project life cycle.
Apart from quality management, contract
administration, and risk management are important aspects of their job.
Let's explore the significance of project managers in the engineering industry.
Engineering projects ranging from mechanical, civil, industrial,
aerospace, chemical, biomedical, electrical, nuclear, agricultural,
and marine engineering projects all require project managers.
Engineering projects require careful planning and communication of the plan to their teams.
Project managers in engineering must have a bachelor's degree or,
in some cases, even a master's degree in the specific engineering field of interest,
as well as project management knowledge and skills such as risk management,
process integration, quality assurance, and procurement.
The IT sector includes industries related to hardware, semiconductor,
and internet service providers, also called ISPs,
as well as those involving software application development, technological upgrades,
computer and network infrastructures, equipment installation, and cybersecurity.
With such a wide range of options, IT project managers must know the fundamental and conceptual
technical knowledge related to networks, hardware, software lifecycle, and cybersecurity.
They need to know terminology commonly used by developers to communicate with them 
effectively.
They also need business acumen to understand project planning, cost, and feasibility.
Efficient finance project managers are required in
the finance industry to enhance productivity and reduce costs.
They oversee a company's financial project planning,
modifications to financial systems, and implementation of technological advances.
They need to be proficient in financial analysis, budgeting, and forecasting.
While finance project managers manage cash flow for payroll and project-related expenses,
many also develop revenue-boosting strategies.
Financial reporting is critical to their job
as they work closely with top executives and other influential people in an organization.
The stakes are high with project management in healthcare,
but quality project management can improve the quality of patient care.
Not only does project management need to facilitate lower costs and improved outcomes,
but patient care is also a major factor.
Healthcare project managers are necessary not only for hospitals and
clinics but also for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers.
Some potential projects handled by healthcare project managers include:
Development of web apps and portals
Facilitation of the construction of new hospital buildings/departments, and
Implementation and integration of new equipment in a facility
To meet such needs, specialized field knowledge is required.
Regulation is a big consideration while managing healthcare-related projects.
A degree in health management, public health, or any related studies is often beneficial.
In the case of the manufacturing sector, project management is
needed when an existing process changes or the need for a new process arises.
When it comes to manufacturing, project managers must keep risks,
hazards, and safety issues in mind.
Unique skills that project managers in this sector must have include vendor account management,
vendor and relationship management,
and streamlining production processes.
In this video, you learned that:
Construction project managers effectively coordinate with stakeholders and resources
while managing day-to-day activities throughout the life cycle of a project.
In the engineering industry, project managers often need a degree in the
specific field, as well as project management knowledge and skills.
To manage projects in the IT industry,
project managers need both technical knowledge and business acumen.
Finance project managers need proficiency in financial analysis, budgeting, and forecasting.
Project management in the healthcare industry is
high stakes because quality patient care is paramount.
In the manufacturing industry, project management is needed for
changes to existing processes or for implementing a new process.

Information Technology Project Management

Welcome to "IT Project Management."
After watching this video, you will be able to
describe the opportunities and demand for IT project managers,
summarize the responsibilities of IT project managers, and
explain the specialized skills required for IT project managers.
Information Technology, commonly known as IT, Project Management is a promising field.
Recent surveys have found that there will soon be over 800,000
projected employees in IT project manager positions,
Twenty-five percent of all IT job descriptions call for IT project management skills and
there was a fifty percent increase in demand for IT project managers from 2021 to 2022.
Information Technology has the most project managers compared to other
industries and tends to have higher average salaries than other fields.
It is no surprise that becoming an IT Project Manager is a popular choice for PMs.
An IT project manager is a project manager in the information technology industry.
The projects they are expected to manage might be initiatives
to create new products or improve and expand existing technology and systems.
The role of the IT project manager, like any other project manager,
is to manage the project's budget and schedules, and lead project teams.
An IT project manager has many responsibilities, many of which
overlap with the responsibilities of a non-IT project manager.
The primary responsibilities of an IT project manager include:
Managing multiple small to medium-sized projects throughout the project lifecycle,
Establishing a clear project definition, scope,
goals, and deliverables with support from the project management team,
Working within deadlines and budgets, monitoring progress,
organizing meetings, and creating status reports,
Identifying gaps, following the team's project governance structure,
and optimizing the project and process,
and may involve managing testing programs like beta software releases.
Implementing strategies that deliver projects on schedule and within budget,
Managing resources for projects, such as computer equipment and employees,
Communicating with stakeholders such as IT managers, project personnel, vendors,
and end-users regarding project requirements.
In addition, IT project managers are also expected to have some specialized skills.
For instance, they should be familiar with various concepts and practices such as:
The Software Development Life Cycle, or SDLC.
The SDLC is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality,
low-cost software in the shortest possible production time.
An IT project manager should be familiar with the SDLC stages of planning, analysis,
design, development, testing, implementation, and maintenance.
They should also be familiar with software engineering fundamentals,
including Object-Oriented Analysis and Design, or OOAD,
a method to analyze and design an application through an
object-oriented approach and the testing process.
Additionally, they should be able to work with Agile methodology and frameworks,
such as Scrum or Kanban.
They should also be familiar with the Waterfall methodology,
which breaks project activities down into linear and sequential phases.
Another important skill is knowledge of Information Systems Security.
IT project managers will be expected to assist in establishing safe practices and system
configurations in order to protect information systems from unwanted access or destruction.
They should also have a working knowledge of
information systems security standards and practices,
such as access control, system hardening, system auditing,
log file monitoring, security policies, and incident handling.
IT project managers should also have a conceptual understanding
of API integrations, the connection of two application programming interfaces;
and DevOps, a set of practices, tools, and philosophies that bring together IT
operations and software development to more quickly produce new software
Another valuable skill is incident management.
IT project managers will have to respond to unplanned events or service
interruptions and be able to restore the service to an operational state.
They should also be familiar with IT management,
or the monitoring and administering of an organization's IT systems.
This includes understanding the organization's hardware, software,
and networks, as well as how to make them run more efficiently.
Finally, IT project managers may also be responsible for quality
management or ensuring that the quality of an organization's product or service is consistent.
This could involve tasks in quality planning,
quality assurance, quality control, and quality improvement.
As you can see, there are many skills and responsibilities that are unique to
IT project managers, as well as those shared across different types of project managers.
In this video, you learned that IT project management:
Is a growing field, with a projected 30,000 jobs to open up in the next ten years.
Job openings are expected to grow at a higher rate than average.
In addition to the usual responsibilities, it requires unique responsibilities
such as implementing IT strategy,
managing IT resources, and communicating with IT managers, employees, and clients.
Other requirements include technical skills, familiarity with concepts
like the SDLC, OOAD, API integrations, and DevOps;
the ability to work with Agile and Waterfall methodologies; and IT-relevant knowledge,
including Information Systems Security, incident management, IT management, and quality 
management.

Expert Viewpoints: Industry-Specific Skills

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Industry-specific skills.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing which
project management skills are transferrable and which are unique between industries.
The great thing about project management is
you can easily change your skills from one industry over to another.
It's very similar.
The biggest impact I would say, especially if you're new,
you just need to know how to make those changes from one company to another.
So for example, a company A that I worked at before we use a lot
of waterfall methodologies versus now I have to use many different types,
so I had to make that adjustment when I first made that change.
I really, truly feel as a project manager you can go from telecom for
example over to security without having to make a whole lot of adjustments.
Sometimes we just have to relearn.
What I've found is
your soft skills translate perfectly between industries. You know, being good with people
being able to be that diplomat that's able to motivate people to
figure out what's going wrong and how to fix it.
Those are all very important and translate.
Besides that, your obvious skills, just knowing the software, Jira, Smartsheets,
Microsoft Project, whatever you're doing, being well versed in all of those things,
being detailed oriented understanding, scheduling, all of those things translate well.
I think that doesn't translate is, you know, the specific information about an industry.
So, before my role as a project manager, I actually planned events for many years,
and there's a lot of skills that I find that transfer to differ
and from different jobs into project management. So, things like being detail-oriented,
that's something that, you know, is useful whether you are a finance professional,
whether you're a teacher or a writer.
Anything really.
Being detail-oriented is a, is a skill that can be transferred, organization and kind of
having that mindset where you can take a complex problem and break it down into smaller parts.
That's a skill set that can be transferred between many industries.
The skills that overlap in project management across different industries
are the problem solving, creative thinking, communication skills.
You need that across the board.
And the skills that are really specific to my industry are understanding the nuances of
online learning and the different roles that touch the different pieces of online learning courses.
So that means specifically working with instructional designers,
people who work in graphics, who work on the support end, for teacher, for faculty, for
every different person who is going to interact with the course.
So that's what's really specific to my industry is
having those different roles that are specific to online learning.
Let me share with you some of the key skills that a project manager is recommended to try to attain.
A project manager needs to be a good motivator, a good negotiator, a good conflict manager,
a good coach, a good influencer, a good decision maker, a good team builder, and also a good
project manager needs to be aware of all of the different cultures that he or she is dealing with.
If you are a project manager, a process manager, a product owner, regardless of
the position and management that you're in, those skills required to be an effective project
manager are similar to the skills required for success in any management position.
If there is one skill that is unique to project management,
it is understanding the particular life cycle and following that particular life cycle and process.
A traditional project goes through 5 phases, initiating, planning,
executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing.
These life cycles are very specific to project management and this is something that the project 
manager needs to be aware of if you follow the process, you have a great chance of being 
successful.

Path to Becoming a Project Manager

identify common project management certifications and their requirements,
discuss different ways to gain experience in project management.
Qualified project managers are required in almost every industry more than ever before.
The role of a project manager can be enriching.
However, before you begin your career path as a project manager, you need to understand
what qualifications are required to be successful in this role.
Some important qualifications are:
training,
certifications,
and experience.
While many jobs require an undergraduate degree, and a degree may help you qualify for more
job options, there are still several jobs that hire without a degree.
And, while project management training is not always a requirement for qualification,
some amount of training is generally recommended.
There are two forms of training that people can take who aspire to become project managers:
formal and informal.
You can receive formal project management training at an institution while getting a
degree.
While there are not many colleges that offer project management degrees, many colleges
offer project management certificates that you can earn while getting your degree or
after you graduate.
These certificate programs offer in-person or online courses in project initiation, detailed
project planning, risk management, and more.
For those that require greater flexibility in their schedules, there are also informal
training opportunities.
There are many self-paced online learning courses, such as this one, as well as many
professional certificates from companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft.
The Project Management Institute also offers self-paced courses.
Many project management professionals start their careers in non-project management roles.
Occasionally, organizations will provide project management training in-house with professional
development courses and training programs.
These organizations guide and mentor the candidates to become project managers.
Your manager may also know of opportunities within the organization to gain project management
skills and experience.
Certifications are the process by which you prove that you have the knowledge, skills,
and experience to perform in a project management role.
The following certifications are developed and administered by project management bodies
such as the Project Management Institute or PMI, Scrum Alliance, Comp-TIA, and the Global
Academy of Project Management or GAPM.
Obtaining a certification in project management or a relevant field is an excellent way to
gain technical knowledge and credibility.
Most certifications provide insight into the role and industry, as well as hands-on learning
and experience.
Plus, they quickly show potential employers the experience and skills you have in project
management.
In addition to project management certifications, some employers in specific industries will
also favor candidates with other industry-related certifications as well.
For example, an IT project manager could benefit from both a project management certificate
and a CompTIA ITF+ certification or perhaps even an A+ certificate.
A PM in the construction industry might need both a project management certificate and
an associate constructor certificate from the American Institute of Constructors.
There are many project management certifications that are available, but here are a few common
certifications to explore.
Many entry-level project managers begin with a CAPM certification.
The Certified Associate in Project Management certificate, administered by the Project 
Management
Institute, is a starting point for anyone interested in a project coordinator or project
associate role.
To qualify to take the CAPM, you must have a secondary degree such as a high school diploma,
GED, or equivalent, and have at least 23 hours of project management education.
After getting CAPM certified, many people go on to get the Project Management Professional,
called the PMP certification.
The PMP certification requires a secondary or 4-year degree, either 36 or 60 months of
experience leading projects, and at least 35 hours of project management education or
a CAPM certification.
Common project management certifications in agile project management include Certified
ScrumMaster or CSM through the Scrum Alliance.
To become a Certified ScrumMaster, you must complete a CSM course and pass the CSM test.
You can also get a Professional Scrum Master or PSM Certification through Scrum.org.
There are no requirements to take the PSM certification assessment, but you may find
it useful to review the Scrum Guide and practice assessment provided by Scrum.org.
Finally, if you are interested in a career in IT project management, it may be useful
to get a CompTIA A+ certification.
The Computing Technology Industry Association or CompTIA provides this certification to
display knowledge in IT support tasks
such as troubleshooting, identifying, and configuring hardware and software troubleshooting.
Nine to twelve months of experience is recommended but not required to take the certification
exams.
Lastly, the most important qualification a person can have is experience.
But how does one get experience for your first job?
One way to gain experience is by turning a personal goal like planting a garden or writing
a book into a project.
Use project management methods and tools to manage your project and reach your goal.
Another way to gain experience is by volunteering.
Many non-profit organizations have projects they need to lead.
This can give you an opportunity to gain exposure to new projects and learn about leadership
management.
You may find that you can get an apprenticeship, internship, or co-op.
These roles are often designed as partnerships between community organizations, colleges,
students, and corporate employers.
In these types of programs, you can get on-the-job training and mentoring while you work and
explore specific careers and industries.
Finally, you can see about co-leading a project or shadowing a project manager in your current
industry or school.
Learning experiences such as these boost your confidence and prepare you for more responsible
roles.
In this video, you learned:
Many colleges offer project management certificates that you can receive while you are getting
your degree.
Informal training opportunities are available through self-paced courses for those that
require more flexibility with schedules.
Certifications are the process by which you prove that you have the knowledge, skills,
and experience to perform in a project management role.
Common certifications for project management include the CAPM, PMP, CSM, and PSM.
You can get experience for your first role in project management through a number of
ways,
including managing personal projects, volunteering, co-ops, internships, and shadowing or co-
leading
a project in your current role.

Career Progression in Project Management
Welcome to "Career Progression in Project Management."
After watching this video, you will be able to
outline the various career paths available to project management professionals, and
describe the roles and responsibilities in each position.
Project management professionals can pursue a variety of career paths.
Project managers may progress from entry-level roles to more senior roles.
They can eventually progress to senior executive-level roles.
Let's explore the career progression from an
entry-level project coordinator to more senior roles such as a VP of Operations.
While most careers do not follow a straight-forward, linear path,
the typical role progression in an organization would be:
Beginning a career as a Project Coordinator,
then becoming a Project Manager, then a promotion to Senior Project Manager.
After years of experience managing individual projects with complex parts,
a senior project manager may move into the role of program manager and then
portfolio manager.
Some program and portfolio managers who lead many successful projects may attain roles such as
Director of Project Management or VP of Operations.
Those interested in a career in project management may start as an
entry-level project coordinator.
This is an administrative position in charge of the generation and
distribution of project reports and often also deals with scheduling.
A project coordinator is a member of the project management team who
assists with the project.
Project coordinators will
attend meetings and assist on minor aspects of the project,
meet with the project team regularly to report on progress and
discuss any potential roadblocks,
prepare meeting agendas and notes, and maintain project and meeting schedules.
After some time as a project coordinator, you can progress to a project manager.
A project manager is an entry- or mid-level role who uses appropriate tools, techniques,
and processes to complete a project successfully.
A project manager is responsible for:
balancing resource availability with resource requirement,
working within project constraints that include budget, scope, and schedule, and
meeting and managing key stakeholders'
expectations related to quality standards.
Experienced project managers can then become senior project managers.
A senior project manager is often also a member of a larger management team.
A senior project manager may be in charge of
projects that have a broader scope or are more complex.
They may also oversee multiple projects and must determine which
projects and tasks need to be prioritized.
After gaining a rich experience of working at the project level in an organization,
a project management professional can advance to the role of program management.
A program is a collection of projects managed together to reap benefits
that would not be possible had they been managed individually.
Program management involves greater responsibility as it requires
overseeing multiple, simultaneous projects that are dependent on one another.
To succeed, a program manager must:
develop program-level plans,
strategically manage several projects,
analyze the business benefits of a program, and
manage project dependencies.
As someone continues to progress in their career,
they advance into a senior role and may become a portfolio manager.
This position carries a great deal of responsibility and,
hence, requires rich experience and expertise.
A portfolio manager is responsible for a group of
projects and programs managed together to achieve strategic business goals.
Hence, a portfolio manager is in charge of the centralized
management of one or more portfolios to achieve the goals of an organization.
Very experienced project management professionals can attain senior and executive-level positions,
such as Director of the Project Management Office (PMO) and Vice President of Operations.
The Director of Project Management is a senior management-level position that requires five or
more years of managerial experience plus project management experience.
They oversee other senior-level project, program, and portfolio managers.
They are responsible for guiding, instructing, and developing project management operations and 
structuring processes and workflows.
They ensure overall project governance by establishing project delivery standards, protocols, and 
tools.
The Vice President of Operations is an executive-level position that requires ten years of industry 
experience.
The Vice President is accountable for developing and implementing efficient and cost-effective 
operations that drive the current and future goals of the organization.
They are responsible for operating, managing, planning, and coordinating the overall operations of 
an organization.
They ensure operations run smoothly by setting a strategic, operational vision and enforcing an 
organization's policies and procedures.
In this video, you learned that:
A project coordinator is an entry-level administrative position responsible for creating and 
distributing project reports.
A project manager is responsible for managing the necessary tools, techniques, and processes to 
successfully complete a project.
A senior project manager oversees multiple projects and decides which needs to be prioritized.
A program manager oversees multiple projects, analyzes business benefits, manages project 
dependencies, and develops program-level plans.
A portfolio manager supervises the centralized management of one or more portfolios to achieve 
organizational goals.
The Director of Project Management guides, instructs, and develops project management
operations, structures the workflow, and ensures overall project governance.
The Vice President of Operations is in charge of operating, managing,
planning, and coordinating a project's overall operations.

Expert Viewpoints: Describe your career path

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Describe your career path.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing the
path they took to their current careers.
So for about a 20-year period, I was a project manager in the United States Air Force.
I retired from the Air Force and immediately found some consulting jobs in project management.
In 2003, I received my project management
professional certification from the Project Management Institute.
I do have multiple certifications and I enjoy
using those certifications for a more important reason that is teaching as I had mentioned
earlier or I teach at four different universities and the one thing that I have found is that
if you teach, you really have to learn what you are teaching, and that has really helped
me in my path to get to the point where I can be a subject matter expert today.
I ended up finding a startup that was working on online learning for adults.
And I stayed at that startup because I really liked the work environment.
That startup became a public company and I just really liked the fast-paced environment.
And in that company, I was actually a producer for a while, and that meant
that I was constantly thinking on my feet on set,
filming several different professors at once for their online learning courses.
And that meant so many interviews, roundtable discussions, vignettes and doing really cool
things even with actors and all of that was across several different types of fields.
So I worked in production for an online physical therapy degree,
which was I learned so much, so much.
I worked in online learning for cybersecurity at Berkeley and Data Science.
And in nursing programs, one nursing program at Northwestern and several more.
And I really just enjoyed all of the connections that I would make with
people and which was actually the most important part for me.
So even though I was managing production pieces of that, I really like the connections I was 
making
with these different folks to create life into
these projects and that involved into me working across even more projects.
And then learning more about project management and continuing to use those
skills of thinking on my feet being creative loving relationships and that's how I got here.
In 2010, I started working at a local call center for a very
large telecom company, taking in billing calls.
So I started out only $10.00 an hour,
but I know I needed to get my foot in the door in IT and start learning from others.
From there I worked very hard and became an operations manager for the enterprise section.
After that point, I moved on to their net app department and became a P1 duty manager.
I knew that I really needed to grow on my education and learn
a lot more in order to pursue anything else in it.
From there I went over to the University of Central Florida,
took a lot of classes and project management, HR, marketing, pretty much you name it.
I tried to do everything I could to see where I wanted to go.
When I took the project management course, I knew that was definitely the direction I wanted.
I'm very detail oriented and organized.
And I just love projects.
I got very excited.
We got to do
our own in class as well.
From there I moved over to a company called audio code.
I was a project manager. I took on quite a bit of projects and I started mentoring others.
I wanted to pursue even more within that company and I worked very hard
to teach others as much as I knew about the company itself,
project management and I was able to get promoted over to PMO Director.
From there I had 12 direct reports while also managing very large
projects at the same time.
I then wanted to go ahead and grow my career and I moved over to Zscaler in 2021 as a senior 
project
manager and currently mentoring others, working very large enterprise projects for them as well.
Now, my story is a little bit funny because back when I was at USC
and my friends were all making like seven bucks an hour working in the library or in some office.
I was making 50 bucks an hour helping medium size businesses, computerize.
And so that came to bear with all the other things I'd been doing.
So running projects for college even in high school.
You know, learning to be organized, learning to be detailed oriented
being a good communicator, all kind of came together.
Later when I moved into what I consider kind of the upper ranks of a consulting
project manager, it really was, you know, years of doing a lot of different projects
that put me in the position to get a higher paying job as a project manager.
So I started off as an event planner early,
early in my career, planning weddings and concerts, and entertainment events.
And I got a job as a business consultant and really took an interest in project management.
And so my first couple of projects, I worked as a pseudo-project manager,
really taking in kind of a lot of things that I could learn about
project management from the people around me and the teams around me.
So I started doing project management for some of my clients.
I ended up landing a client where I helped them move from a waterfall
project management methodology to an agile project management
methodology and really kind of fell in love with some of the agile frameworks.
And the scale agile framework.
And now I both manage projects as a business consultant,
but also help organizations develop content for project management courses and pass on
the expertise that I've learned as I've you know, worked in project management

Expert Viewpoints: Job hunting and career 
progression tips

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Job hunting and career progression tips.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing tips
for job hunting and progressing in a career as a project manager.
Number one, find a mentor, find someone that you can follow,
find someone who will be a coach to you.
Someone that you can respect, someone that you can understand,
someone who has had a successful career in project manager.
Number two, be an active listener, you have two ears.
You have two eyes, and you have one mouth.
There's a reason why we have two ears.
Listening will allow you to absorb more information than speaking.
Find that mentor, find that individual who has a quote on quote,
"Been there and done it," and listen closely.
In addition, make sure that you learn from both positive and negative examples.
As a project manager, you're going to see some people who just flat out do not do it well.
You're going to see others who are very, very successful.
Watch the people who do not do project management well.
Try to determine why did they fail.
Watch the people who perform project management well, ask yourself.
Why did they succeed?
Oftentimes the positive examples are outstanding,
but in reality, we oftentimes learn more from the negative examples.
First off, start with informal interviews.
Any type of job that you're thinking about going into.
It's very helpful. You can understand from their point of view what it's like in their day-to-day.
If they really, truly like their career and it gives you an opportunity to learn from them,
that could also be a potential for mentorship in the future.
I would recommend studying for the PMP, even if you don't.
Have the hours it's. Still good to know the foundations of project management,
and it will help you understand quite a bit more.
Many places do require a bachelor's degree, so please make sure you are.
At least taking. The bare minimum courses like marketing, project management, finance,
all of those type of classes will actually help you out in the long run as well.
I think the number one thing is to really look at your skills and,
um, how you are working with people.
Do you enjoy working with teams? Uh, do you care about, you know,
people in a way where you're gonna go through both the fun and the difficult times?
Because you will have, in almost every project, you know, things will go and it won't be easy.
There will be times where, uh, something simply fails unexpectedly, and you have to fix it.
Uh, so you have to have patience and people skills to be able to do that.
The advice that I would give someone who is trying to launch their career right now
in project management, is that follow the path that feels the best to you for what
you want to do, and specifically in the organization that you want to work with.
I have a lot of education.
I worked and got my masters.
And then got my doctorate in organizational change and leadership,
and that was my path because I happen to just love school.
But I have had coworkers and colleagues that have far different types of education,
but a lot more experience specifically in project management.
So there's there are different ways to get
to where you want to be. You focus in on what is the best for you.
What has helped you most in advancing your career?
Surround yourself with really great people.
One of the things that I will share with you is the most dangerous project
manager is the individual who says, "I don't need any help. I've got this."
A good project manager knows what they know, knows what they do not know,
and surrounds themselves with people who know what they do not know.
Project management is an individual sport in a sense,
as the project manager, you are accountable for outcomes.
But in reality, project management is a team sport.
Surround yourself with good people, build the team and I think you'll be very,
very successful in all of your projects and in the long-term advancing your career.
Get a career coach.
My career coach helped me out so much building my resume with me,
understanding why it's so important to have a
resume and then even a cover letter and then help me prep for my job interviews.
They are now a long-term career coach and I greatly appreciate them because it's not just
a point of time in my journey, they're helping me out with my overall journey.
Secondly, was my education from the start at UCF.
I was able to understand the basics of project management.
However, when I went over to University of North Carolina for my MBA, I was able to build
relationships with others and truly understand how to network from there with the education itself,
I was able to bring it to the next level.
And pursue my career even further.
So what's helped me the most in advancing my career has really been the ability to
look for different projects and be open for those kinds of special opportunities.
So when I first started working, for example, for a boutique firm
in Chicago as a consulting project manager, you know, being recognized as somebody who's
very good at fixing problems was probably one of the keys to my really advancing.
So being in a position to understand that all of my different life skills from,
like I said, being a diplomat to being highly organized and extremely good with people,
suddenly put me in a position to say that if there's a project that needs help, I can fix it.

What Inspired Us to Create this Course?
 	
Welcome to "What Inspired Us to Create this Course."
Project management can be a highly rewarding career path.
The need for qualified project managers is greater than ever before across all industries.
To understand this discipline, one should have a clear understanding of the responsibilities
of this position.
Project management entails leading a team through all the stages of a project successfully.
Project managers are chiefly responsible for the planning, development, delivery, and closure
of a project in a set timeframe.
To accomplish the mission, project managers should be well-versed in project management
tools, techniques, and processes.
To explain in greater detail and provide insights to learners, we aim to create a course that
focuses on the structure of project management and its practical application in dealing with
real-world scenarios.
Each project has its own set of challenges, even though you have the right tools and resources
to address them.
It is important for you to have the ability to deal with them.
This course aims to familiarize you with how to make yourself ready for the project management
role.
Our dual emphasis on structure and adaptability will help you modify your approach based on
the situations and the different phases of a project.
We believe project management is a valuable life skill for anyone from any background.
A few key skills that can benefit any professional are:
Knowing how to track and manage a budget.
Knowing how to deliver things on time, And knowing how to manage and communicate
with stakeholders.
So, even if project management is not the primary focus of your career, the topics we
cover in the series will be beneficial to achieving your career goals.
In this course, we will focus on how a project begins and the skills needed to ensure its
success.
How to Make the Most Out of this Course

Welcome to "How to Make the Most Out of this Course."
This course is part of a series of courses intended to teach project management skills.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain the concept of the rainbow path.
List the certificates these courses are designed to support.
And, explain the best way to get the most out of this series.
This Project Management Series shows the path and tools when time and resources are plenty.
This is known as the rainbow path because everything is perfect in this scenario.
While having an ideal project is certainly something to aspire to, it doesn't always
work out that way in the real world.
This series strives to take the methodology and tools one step further into how they will
work in real-life situations on a project.
However, knowing the rainbow path is important so that you, as a project manager, know what
steps to take to keep your projects as perfect as possible.
These courses are specifically designed to help anyone seeking a PMI-PMP (or Project
Management Professional) certification or a PMI-CAPM (or Certified Associate in Project
Management) certification from the Project Management Institute, or PMI.
All the concepts, methodologies, processes, and tools presented in this series are drawn
from project management resources, such as the PMI and our expertise.
The PMI's Project Management Body of Knowledge, version 7 (or PMBOK7), serves as the 
foundation
of our courses; however, some information is drawn from other models in this series.
Although there is currently no experience credit associated with taking these courses,
the benefit of learning about project management from different perspectives and how it can
be used in real-life scenarios will lay a great foundation for professionals seeking
a career in project management.
This can produce great results.
You may use these courses to show that you have completed the required contact hours
to take the certification examination.
To fully reap this series' benefits, we recommend you go through all the courses.
Devote time to labs and the completion of exercises to test your knowledge and see how
the learning can be applied to real-life situations.
Being attentive and taking notes will help you retain the knowledge you will gain during
the series.
Pursue this series diligently like any other high-level course, which will significantly
help you in your next project.

Expert Viewpoints: Importance of Project 
Management

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Importance of Project Management.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing why project management is important.
So I think that great project management really allows members of a team to focus intently
on the work that needs to get done to meet the project objectives rather than spending
a lot of time trying to figure out what needs to get done or doing rework because they aren't
working maybe on the right things or they don't have all the information that they need
to complete the tasks that they need to get done.
I think very good project managers help teams anticipate and mitigate and even resolve risks
and issues that come up in challenges that come up during the lifecycle of the project.
And then I also think that having clear deliverables that are communicated clearly, that are defined
early on in the project, they're communicated frequently.
They help the team know exactly what's going on and when it needs to get done.
I think project management is more important now than ever.
There are so many more remote project teams than ever before and teams are spread across
multiple timezones.
And while teams are physically apart, the speed of communication is happening fast through
collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft teams.
So, you need that central person to track the broad and rapid communication and make
sure information is getting to the right people at the right time so everyone can deliver
their best quality work.
The project manager really is the rudder that kind of steers the project ship.
When you think about what the project manager does, they are responsible for managing the
schedule, managing all the individual tasks that need to happen.
They're responsible for communicating with upper management and with the team about the
project status, about changes and requirements.
So, the project manager really is that person that's responsible for making sure that the
project is moving in the direction that it's supposed to be moving in.
Think about a government without government officials or a corporation without a CEO.
The project manager really is essential in ensuring that the project goals are met and
that the project meets those goals.
When I think about a project without a project manager or even projects that have poor project
management projects end up, you know, doing similar work over and over again.
They end up repeating tasks or missing schedules or deadlines.
There's been some projects that I've been a part of that have been self-managed where
the team tries to manage the tasks and schedules on their own and there's too many voices.
People assume things are getting done when they're not getting done.
People assume they know the tasks when they really don't know the tasks that need to be
accomplished for a project.
So, the project manager is the individual or the team that takes all of the essentials
of a project and ensures those essentials are being accomplished, those goals are being
met.

Expert Viewpoints: Project Management - The 
Journey
Welcome to Expert
Viewpoints: Project Management - The Journey.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing the journey and destination of
project management.
Let's begin with the destination.
What is the destination?
What is the ultimate goal of a project?
On time, within budget, and providing scope to satisfy the customer's needs.
Being able to move the bar for the organization to provide value.
But it's not all about the destination.
The journey is working together, building the team, gaining new skills, building new
relationships.
It's achieving success not only for the organization
but for yourself.
It's about in addition to being empowered to make a difference.
Within a project itself, you can think about the actual journey is going through the project.
What happens at the very beginning, during the middle, and then towards the end?
How did you get to your destination, which is the end result?
So, did you actually complete the project at time with its scope and budget and then
also add in what your lessons are learned?
The difference between the journey and the
destination of project management is the difference
between the tasks and the people and the schedule that is meant to accomplish the goals of the
project and the final deliverable.
The final product that you're delivering.
So let's suppose that a project is building software.
They're building a software package.
The journey is about the process that's involved in building that software.
Who's going to do what jobs, what resources do we need to accomplish our goals?
What are the goals?
What's the vision of the product?
What are some potential roadblocks?
What are dependencies that this project has?
What do we need to make sure that we have in place so that we can accomplish all of
our tasks.
The destination is the software product itself, along with any extra things that are needed
to get that software to the customer.
So for example, marketing or some advertising manuals that the, or user guides that the
software will need to support it.
Ensuring that there's a software support system in place for that software package.
That's the destination.
Ensuring that all those things are in place.
Well, first of all, I would advise all of you to try to understand, as best you can,
the art of project management.
This includes effective communications, influencing
motivation, coaching and more.
Learn these skills.
Try to be as good at these skills as you can.
But along with those business skills or soft skills.
Understand the science of project management as well, understand lifecycles.
Know how a project needs to be planned from beginning to end and know what you know and
know what you don't know and surround yourself with people who know what you don't know.
One of the big myths is that the project manager needs to be the expert in everything that
is wrong.
A project manager needs to understand where they are, the expert, but also where they're
not the expert and surround themselves with people who are.
A successful journey is well thought out and well-planned.
It doesn't skip the planning part of the actual journey.
You have to have that in order to have a
successful journey.
From there, you're able to gather all the right resources.
It might be products.
It might be people involved like your team members, but making sure that you have all
the right resources.
And then to have a successful destination as to understand the true scope and expectations.
I think there's many things that a project manager can do to ensure a successful journey
and to ensure that the destination is reached.
In my experience, probably the biggest aspect of a good project manager is (communication.
A project manager has to be both a coach as well as a person that's able to drive the
project forward.
I don't think a project manager needs to be a subject matter expert on every aspect of
the project or what the project team is building.
But they do need to be able to talk about what that project comprises.
Some of the technical aspects of that project, and they need to have that that level of expertise
so that they can communicate properly to every
stakeholder and and person involved in accomplishing
the goals of that project.
So, communication to me is a big one.
Another one is being able to manage time.
And this it sounds like a it sounds like it's a very basic thing to be able to manage time.
We all have to manage time in our day and what we're going to accomplish and what we're
going to be doing in a given day.
But when I talk about time management, I'm talking about being able to know how different
aspects of the project need to get accomplished, in what order.
A third aspect for ensuring that the journey is done in a way that accomplishes the project's
goals is to know how to weight things.
And what I mean by that is not everything is worth calling a meeting for or not.
Everything is worth sending out a broad email to upper management and to the team.
Some things need to be ignored sometimes.
So, that weighting aspect, I think is very, very important.
So, that that those three aspects along with a bunch of other things.
But those to me are very critical for ensuring that the journey of a project is successful.
Ensuring that the destination is successful really means to me thinking through what does
the end game look like?
I think a lot of project managers look at the tasks that need to be accomplished and
what the team is going to do for those tasks.
But they forget that once the project is is done, once that the product is built or whatever
it is that you're delivering as is accomplished.
What does that look like?
How do you communicate that out that things are completed?
How do you ensure that stakeholders are satisfied?
You may think that you accomplished the project's goals, but your stakeholders, the people that
are actually receiving the product, may not agree with you.
So, you might ask a question like, Is there going to be a follow on to this project where
things that we weren't able to get to in the first version we want to accomplish in the
second version.
Asking those types of questions.
Once you've delivered the product or the project is complete so, that your stakeholders have
an opportunity to provide more input there.
So, the destination really is about thinking about it ahead of time, playing it out in
your mind, almost role playing.
The project is now done.
What does that mean?
How do we get this to the customer?
How do we get this to the user?
How do we get this to upper management?
So, really ensuring that the the stakeholders are happy.
Upper management is happy and your team is happy at the end of the project.

Expert Viewpoints: Project Management - The 
Journey Example
Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Project Management - The Journey Example. In this video,
we will hear from project managers discussing the journey examples of project management.
I highly recommend each and every one of you to if you have a chance visit www.PMI.org.
That's the project management institute and I want to share ever so briefly a very
successful project and give you a couple of reasons why it was so successful.
First of all, the challenge, a catastrophic weather event, destroyed roads and cut
off British Columbia's lower mainland, including Vancouver from the rest of Canada.
A huge project was needed. What was the solution? British Columbia's Ministry
of Transportation and Infrastructure used a project management approach based on a guide
to the project management Body of Knowledge, the acronym for that is the PMBOK Guide.
They use this guide to prioritize repairs and reopen critical routes as quickly as possible.
This included network analysis, identifying critical paths, requirements analysis, creating
a work breakdown structure, communications planning, implementing communication
protocols, risk management, preparing risk assessment and responses. And in addition,
soliciting the management of contributors and interested parties as well. What I shared with
you a moment ago: Know what you know, know what you don't know, and surround yourself
with people who know what you don't know. So, what was the outcome? Highway five,
the principal corridor for transportation of goods to and from the Port of Vancouver, Canada,
was reopened to commercial traffic in 35 days. This is a successful project and we hope that all
of your projects can be equally as successful. So, I got a project that my last company and
it was very large. I had over 200 sites and it was global. And to give you a key idea,
it was a plastics company. So, they're all over the world. COVID hit in the middle of it. We
had our plan really thought out as far as our overall journey. And of course, it changed. But
since we plan so well in advance, we were able to easily shift around the different locations.
And then we still had the end result for our destination, which was to complete those sites.
An example of a project that I thought run really well and met the criteria of successful
journey as well as a successful destination was at my time at a big corporation. I was on
a team that was developing a product that was essentially last in the competitive landscape
and our team had to play catch up. And there was a project manager that
helped us get there from a marketing perspective and what she would do is get us all into her
room twice a week. And she had a really nice spreadsheet and she would have everyone go
through their items in the spreadsheet. She kept our project time boxed or line items.
She kept our line items time boxed so that we didn't, you know, rattle on about things
that weren't important. If, as we were giving our status, we went off track,
she would ensure that we stayed on track and she would gently nudge us back into the right
frame of minds that we were talking about, the items that we needed to talk about.
And I remember at the time, I thought that even though she was very direct and she kept the
project moving and she kept us all on task, she did it in a way that actually kept us motivated.
So as we saw project progress every other day or, you know, twice a week we actually
got motivated. It was a lot of work and she kept us on task and we weren't allowed to not deliver,
but she did it in a way that I always felt like, hey, we're actually doing something.
We're getting. We're making the project better. We're moving this project forward by ensuring that
our customers know what our product does and why it does it better than the competition.
So in terms of that journey, she was a really good project manager for helping us make progress,
you know, every day that we had to work on something and informing the rest of our
peers and management about that progress and then being able to see the impact of
that progress in our product in the, the general product that we were building. But
also see that result in the marketplace as we are making you know reaching those goals

How is this Course Different?

stand out, And list the three common project constraints.
This course focuses on project management methodologies, structures, and principles.
Principles and methodologies do provide the foundation needed to address most project
scenarios.
But this course goes further than other project management courses by focusing on both the
science and the art of managing a project.
We achieve this unique combination of art and science by encouraging project managers
to look at the project through a new lens and to adopt creative approaches, including
innovative solutions and unique methods, such as data-driven decision-making and involving
stakeholders.
This approach ensures the long-term sustainability and effectiveness of projects.
With most projects leaders are overburdened, and the production team has aggressive goals.
And as a result, supply orders may become delayed.
A project manager must work within a defined budget and timeframe despite these constraints
and tight deadlines.
A successful project manager should know how to navigate these and other challenging scenarios.
In this course, we will explore concepts, tools, and tips and tricks to execute projects
successfully.
Business leaders often face three main project management constraints:
Time, Cost,
And scope.
Managing these three constraints can be challenging for a project manager, but it is also the
primary goal.
While other project management courses focus on only two constraints, this course will
push you to succeed with all three.
In our course, we provide key insights from project management specialists and detailed
instructions on using and implementing project management tools.
We will also teach you about different project management models to help you adapt to various
projects and shifting demands.
This includes insights into selecting and tailoring project management models depending
on the project's needs.
By streamlining your project management processes using the tools and tips you'll learn in
this course, you'll be able to deliver projects that are on time, below budget, and within
scope.
In this video, you learned that: This course teaches you the art and science
of project management, The 3 main constraints projects face are time,
cost, and scope, And this course provides professional insights,
instructions, and models for project managers to navigate challenges.

Overview of Key Project Management Models
This article will teach you about phase-oriented project management models and their principles. It 
will also cover a few adaptive project management models and their principles.
The Waterfall model
The Waterfall model serves as the foundation for almost every project management approach. It is 
one of the core models of project management. It adopts an approach where the project activities 
are divided into sequential phases. Each phase must be completed before the next can begin.
Phases of the Waterfall model
These include:
•	System and software requirements
•	Analysis
•	Design
•	Coding or build
•	Testing
•	Operations
The Waterfall model was first implemented in the manufacturing and construction sectors, where 
altering a plan would be exceedingly costly early in the process. Cost overruns were reduced 
because of a disciplined approach to project management, gathering product specifications, and 
obtaining approvals. Due to the inflexibility of the Waterfall model, other modified versions have 
been developed, including ones with risk management and overlapping stages. Winston W Royce 
included risk management notes to the model in the 1970s to address the model's inherent risks.
Project Management Body of Knowledge edition 7 (PMBOK7)
The Project Management Institute (PMI) is well known for its certifications. To obtain these 
credentials, you must first pass a test based on the Project Management Body of Knowledge, or 
PMBOK. The latest edition, known as PMBOK7, marked a significant transition from phase-based 
project management to principles-based project management. Phases remain significant to the 
PMBOK7 approach, though. For this course, we are adopting the phase names from 
PMBOK6.PMBOK7's emphasis on principles-based project management makes it possible for 
guidance to be easily deployed to various project types, such as those adopting the Waterfall 
approach or those working in sprints. For each principle, information and resources are offered. You 
may also note that the emphasis is on customizing your project management strategy, also known as 
a tailored approach.
Projects In Controlled Environments (PRINCE2)
This model is based on the Waterfall approach and is governed by six aspects, seven principles, 
seven themes, and seven processes. The six aspects are scope, timescale, risk, quality, benefits, and 
cost. The seven principles that represent the guidelines include continued business justification, 
learning from experience, defined roles and responsibilities, management by stages, management by 
exception, focus on products, and tailoring to suit the project environment. The seven themes that 
represent the tools include business case, organization, quality, plans, risk, change, and progress. 
The seven processes that represent the roadmap include starting up a project, initiating a project, 
directing a project, controlling a stage, managing product delivery, managing stage boundaries, and 
closing a project.
A practitioner certification program is available if you want to dive deeper into PRINCE2.
Critical Path Method
The Critical Path Method is widely used with the Program Assessment and Review Technique 
(often called PERT). The longest series of interdependent project activities form a critical path. The 
length of the project is then estimated based on this path. To schedule project activities, the Critical 
Path Method employs an algorithm and the critical path.
Critical Chain Project Management
Eliyahu M. Goldratt created Critical Chain Project Management based on the Critical Path Method 
to help keep resources balanced throughout the project. Compared to the Critical Path Method, this 
approach to project planning and management places greater emphasis on resources, such as team 
members, tools, and software.
Adaptive project management models
These project management models lay great emphasis on responsiveness and flexibility. Like the 
phase-based models we discussed earlier, these models have entire courses and certificates 
dedicated to them. 
These models, which are more adaptable and flexible, include:
•	Agile
•	Scrum
•	Six Sigma Method
•	Lean
•	Kanban
Agile
In an Agile project management model, a project is carried out in iterations using sprints, which are 
typically week-long, as opposed to long and rigid project phases, as followed in Waterfall. Weekly 
processing of design decisions, implementation decisions, prototypes, and client feedback allows 
the end user to be more involved in the design process and enables the team to react swiftly if 
necessary.
Agile: Core values
The Agile Manifesto was created in 2001 and is a declaration of a unifying concept for frameworks 
like Scrum, Extreme Programming, and Feature-Driven Development (FDD). 
The original Agile Manifesto identified four core values that govern Agile. These include:
•	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
•	Working software over comprehensive documentation
•	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
•	Responding to change over following a plan
It is designed to create self-governed, highly collaborative, and adaptable teams.
Agile can be used for most projects. However, for best results, it should be combined with a more 
robust project management approach.
Scrum 
The next project management model is the Scrum methodology, which is ideally suited for Agile 
projects. It is also built to work in sprints, making it agile and adaptable. One significant difference 
is that Scrum has clearly defined Scrum roles.
Scrum roles
Some of the roles include:
•	A Scrum master 
•	A Scrum product owner
•	A Scrum team
A Scrum Master is primarily a project manager. This role involves managing the project in 
accordance with Scrum processes and guidelines. The key responsibility of this role is to remove 
roadblocks for the project team.
A Scrum product owner represents the voice of the customer for the team. The owner establishes 
priorities for the product backlog and ensures that the project achieves a high return on investment 
(ROI).
A Scrum team consists of members who have the technical expertise to contribute to a project. They 
work toward delivering the project on time and with quality.
Six Sigma method
Another project management model is the Six Sigma method. It is a set of tools and techniques used 
for process improvement. Bill Smith, a Motorola engineer, invented this model in 1986. Six Sigma 
is a statistical term that refers to the original goal of having an extremely low rate of product 
defects. Six Sigma is frequently credited with transforming quality management into a profession 
rather than something handled by the production team.
Overall, the Six Sigma method is data driven. Data accuracy is required. It is a system of 
systematically identifying errors and providing methods to eliminate them. Some project managers 
have recently combined Six Sigma and Lean, creating a method known as Lean Six Sigma. With 
Six Sigma's emphasis on variation and Lean's emphasis on process implementation and waste 
reduction, these two methods complement each other well.
Lean 
The application of Lean concepts to project management is referred to as the Lean project 
management model. Lean means delivering value while minimizing waste. Note that waste here 
means improper utilization of resources and time. A bottleneck in a process, for example, is 
considered waste. In such cases, project managers need to take prompt corrective measures to 
prevent bottlenecks. Lean, frequently associated with Just-In-Time (JIT) manufacturing, aims to 
align production with demand by emphasizing productivity, efficiency, and waste reduction.
Lean principles
Lean principles include creating flow, value and value stream, and perfection. 
Creating flow is an important Lean principle. Moving a product through different phases swiftly, 
continuously, and effectively allows space for the next product. Instead of working in huge batches, 
each task is completed in a continuous flow. While Agile has weekly sprints, Lean is a continuous 
process from the beginning to the end. Value and value stream are other key Lean principles. The 
consumer defines the value, and the value stream actively works to reduce waste throughout the 
process. The last Lean principle is perfection. It refers to delivering the best product with the least 
amount of waste.
Kanban
Kanban was developed and used by Toyota as part of the Lean manufacturing model.
The key feature of the Kanban model is real-time communication about capacity and complete 
transparency related to work. Note that Kanban is a Japanese word that means "visual board." Work 
assignments are visually represented on a board. This allows the team members to know the status 
of every work at any stage. This model is based on the pull system, which means that production is 
based on the customer's demand. It is not based on the push system, where a product is produced 
and pushed into the market. The goal is minimizing waste without impacting production and 
creating customer value without increasing costs.
Application of Kanban
The six rules for the application of Kanban were outlined by Taiichi Ohno in Toyota Production 
System: Beyond Large-Scale Production in 1988. They are as follows:
1.	Each process issues requests (Kanban) to its suppliers when it consumes its supplies.
2.	Each process produces according to the quantity and sequence of incoming requests.
3.	No items are made or transported without a request.
4.	The request associated with an item is always attached to it.
5.	Processes must not send out defective items to ensure that the finished products will be 
defect-free.
6.	Limiting the number of pending requests makes the process more sensitive and reveals 
inefficiencies.
These rules very closely follow the Lean methodology guidelines, including eliminating waste to 
streamline processes.
Conclusion
In conclusion, there are different project management models available, each with its own set of 
principles and best practices. The choice of the model depends on the specific needs of the project 
and the environment in which it is being executed. It is important to select the appropriate model for 
the project and to adapt it as needed to ensure project success.

Traditional Project Management
Welcome to "Traditional Project Management."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify two key factors considered to evaluate a project.
Explain four major approaches to project management.
Define the composition of an agile team.
Describe Stacey's Matrix.
Delivering a project can be a challenging task.
A project manager's role is crucial in today's corporate world.
There is a growing need for facilitating high-level processes in businesses.
A project manager needs to consider two key factors when evaluating a project:
First is the frequency of deliverables.
Some clients require products or services to be delivered at the project's end, while
others prefer frequent deliveries throughout the project's lifecycle.
Second is the frequency of modifying specifications of project deliverables.
The project manager must plan accordingly.
In this video, you learned that: The two factors project managers use to evaluate
a project include the frequency of deliverables and the frequency of modifying specifications
of project deliverables.
The four approaches to project management are predictive, incremental, iterative, and
agile, An agile team is an organized group of members
collaborating to deliver a product using an iterative approach.
The project manager role does not exist in the agile team.
Instead, leadership responsibilities are divided among the product owner and the scrum master.
Stacey's Matrix assists project managers in determining the type of approach they need
to deliver a project successfully.
The matrix enables the analysis of two critical criteria:
Requirement uncertainty And the technical degree of uncertainty.

Expert Viewpoints: Lifecycle Selection

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Lifecycle Selection.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing the importance of lifecycle selection.
In your opinion, why is proper lifecycle selection so critical?
I believe the proper project management lifecycle selection is so important because
I've worked on a number of projects with different using
different project management methodologies and lifecycles,
and each project has different characteristics
and different risks that make choosing a lifestyle
that fits those risks and those deliverables and the objectives of the project really important.
Let me give you a statistic.
Per the Project Management Institute,
some 50 to 75% of all projects fail to achieve their desired schedule, cost, and scope goals.
That's not a very exciting track record.
Project management is very, very complex.
A project lifecycle allows you to select the most effective method or roadmap,
if you will, to ensure project success.
In addition, selecting the right life cycle allows you to tailor
your project to meet the project's specific needs in project management.
A one size fits all methodology, unfortunately, will often result in failure.
Choosing the right methodology can be a critical part overall for the team.
The team dynamic, whether it's the customer and the stakeholders,
as it can change how everything is done, along with the communication.
For example, there's Waterfall, Agile, Scrum.
It really depends on what is best for your customer, your stakeholders in your overall team.
What are life cycle selection tips that I can provide?
Life cycle selection tips that come to mind are really understanding the inputs
and outputs into each of the different phases that are part of your project.
Together with that, plan out your critical path.
I think understanding that those three things and the resources who
are involved are really going to get you to the weight lifecycle to use for the project.
Identifying the resources that are both part of the project,
but also your internal stakeholders, your internal sponsors and your client preferences.
What affinity do they have to any one or more of the different Life cycles.
Whether or not it's hybrid, waterfall, scrum or agile, if you've got stakeholder report,
stakeholder approval, and resource commitment,
you should be able to lead a successful project with any one of the life cycles.
To me, I really take a look and take the time to see what I am going to
be developing as far as a product or service.
If it's something that I do every single day and like let's say it's a PB and J,
I'm going to do a waterfall.
It's very simple, step by step.
However, with my last company, for example, we did cloud security.
So, a lot of times we did Agile just because things are changing,
customers environments are different.
So, it really depends on what you're going to do.
So, just a couple of tips.
When choosing a lifecycle
as a beginner in choosing a project management lifecycle can be really difficult.
You may not know all the ins and outs of each of the lifecycles,
and you may not know which questions to ask.
But I think with any project, it's really important to really think about
the key principles of each lifecycle,
the benefits that those lifecycles
produce, and then the challenges and risks that are associated with each of those lifecycles.
And then ask yourself what principles,
what benefits are really going to help you meet the project objectives of the project that you're
getting ready to project, manage the best.
So you can ask yourself questions about things like resourcing means,
budgets, what are project risks,
what's the likelihood that the requirements or the project objectives are going to change?
This is a very simple response. Base your project lifecycle selection on two key factors:
First of all, how much do stakeholders agree on what
the final project deliverables should look like?
If you have five stakeholders and they all agree this is what we need,
that's a high level of agreement.
But if you have five stakeholders and they all have different understanding
or different ideas on what success looks like,
then unfortunately your agreement is low.
Secondly, how complex is the project's technology?
How steep of a learning curve is there going to be for you to be successful?
How much innovation?
How much creativity is going to be required?
What type of lifecycle do you prefer and why?
I'm going to have to build off the previous question and answer
again when technology is complex and agreement is low,
I prefer an agile or scrum approach.
When agreement among stakeholders is high and complexity is low,
then in most cases, a traditional or waterfall method is going to work best.
Don't guess on which lifecycle is going to work well for you.
Use the analysis factors that I shared with you of agreement and complexity
and allow the reality of the project to objectively make that decision for you.
My preference is agile.
You're able to take the time to really work with your team and have that team development moment.
Whether you're doing Q&A, you're doing brainstorming sessions,
but you're doing it throughout your project and
then I also really like the aspect of having sprints.
That way we can really focus on a two week sprint, for example,
on those particular task and then move on.
So, for me, for most projects, I prefer a more agile approach.
So, my favorite framework is a framework called the Scaled Agile Framework.
It's my favorite for big projects at very large organizations.
But on the other hand, when I'm working on personal projects, so,
things that maybe I'm working on around the house or personal projects in my own life,
I do prefer a more traditional waterfall approach.
I like to take a, you know, fail fast methodology in those things.
And I don't like to spend too much time kind of on each phase of the project,
but I do tend in my personal life to take more waterfall approach.

Project Management Phases

Welcome to Project Management Phases.
After watching this video, you'll be able to:
Discuss the purpose of project management phases.
Describe different ways to approach creating phases in a project and some models for doing so.
And list the project phases that will be used in this series of courses.
Project management models consist of phases that a project will go through. Dividing a project
into phases segments the workload into more manageable pieces, making the project manager's
role of planning and guiding a project easier. Phases give the project structure and logical
steps to achieve goals and deliver high quality products. Providing this high-level structure
for the program makes it easier to plan the activities and tasks to complete each phase.
The phases used in project management vary,
and there are different opinions about how many phases to use. Let's look at a few examples.
T
The number of names for the different phases and different structures available is basically
limitless, and new ones will surely be invented in the future as businesses and the project
management profession evolve. If you look closer at the many versions of phases available for
project management, you'll notice that although each set of phases may have different names,
they are generally aligned on the activities needed to complete a project. They are also
usually aligned on the activities that are required to complete a phase. You can look at
the variety of available models and select one that will work best for each project.
For the purposes of the three courses in this series, we will use the project phases
as defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge edition 6 guide, also known as 
PMBOK6.
The 5 phases we will use are:
Initiation
Planning
Execution
Monitoring and Controlling
Closing
As you work your way through the course materials, keep in mind that we have anchored the course 
on
these commonly used phases. Names and combinations of activities may change,
but you should be able to map the activities from one model to another. For example,
you might be using the waterfall model on your project with its six phases:
requirements, system design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. To map
these phases back to the phases used in this course, you could consider both the
implementation and testing phases part of the execution phase in the PMBOK6 model.
Tweaks and adjustments like this are part of tailoring your approach and understanding
how the different models can be adjusted to fit a specific project. In the third
course of this series, we will discuss how a project manager's activities shift
throughout the project lifecycle. From setting up templates through the final closing report,
the role of the project manager shifts throughout the phases.
In this video, you learned that:
Dividing a project into phases helps a project manager plan how to complete a project.
Different models and project structures call for different numbers and names for phases,
but they can often be aligned to a core set of activities.

Different Types of Organizations
Welcome to "Different Types of Organizations."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the effect of organizational structure on project management.
Identify types of organizational structures.
Define how to align project objectives with the organizational strategy.
Organizational structure refers to how a company organizes its tasks, allocates resources,
and coordinates different teams within the organization.
It determines each employee's role and place in the organization and is essential for organizational
growth.
There are different types of organizational structures, and project managers must be able
to identify which model suits them most.
It is important for project managers to understand the fundamental principles of building an
organizational structure.
These include the project manager's authority, role, resource availability, budget control,
and project management administration staff.
With the authority principle, a project manager can make decisions, issue orders, and perform
resource allocation to achieve the set goal.
In some organizations, the authority of a project manager is greater, which enhances
their ability to influence others and achieve the team and organizational goals.
Another principle of building an organizational structure is the project manager's role.
Some organizations hire project managers part-time, while others employ full-time project 
managers,
which impacts project management in the organization.
Next is a project's resource availability.
Some organizations provide resources to plan and manage a project at a high level.
In other organizations, a project manager might face challenges in getting the required
level of support.
Another principle is budget control.
In some organizations, a project manager manages and controls the budget.
While in others, a functional manager manages and controls the budget.
And finally, there's the Project management administration staff.
The staff size may differ depending on the organizational structure.
Staff size impacts how a project manager manages a project.
The two organizational structures the Project Management Institute (or PMI) recognizes are
functional and matrix.
The functional organizational structure follows a hierarchical model.
An organization with a functional structure groups employees into departments based on
specialization.
Every department designates a leader experienced in managing and supervising the functions
of each employee.
Such organizations have a top-down decision-making process in place.
The decision-making power is centralized.
Leaders of different departments communicate regularly to frame the organizational strategy,
and the low-level employees have little information about what's happening outside their 
department.
In the matrix organizational structure, teams or groups report to multiple team leaders.
Each team leader is assigned a member or a team from each functional area applicable
to the project.
So, the functional team member reports to two bosses, the project leader, and the functional
manager.
The three types of matrix structures are weak, balanced, and strong.
In the weak matrix structure, a project manager directly reports to the functional manager
and provides support as a project coordinator with limited power.
The balanced matrix structure is like the weak matrix structure.
Except that in the former, the project manager has more authority and decision-making power.
In the strong matrix structure, a project manager has more power than the functional
manager, can use their project management skills on projects, and can determine resource
allocation.
A project manager needs to have project objectives aligned with the organizational strategy.
Its advantage is that: The project is of high quality and stays within
the budget and timeline, and All the stakeholders understand the project's
goals and objectives.
In order to align the project objectives, managers should complete these five tasks.
Communicate the project's value and aim and encourage significant sponsorship and backing.
Plan to ensure the projects comply with the scope, schedule, and budget and meet the stakeholders'
needs.
Determine what resources are required to complete the project successfully.
Identify the stakeholder's essentials for the project's success and seek their assistance.
Finally, create a project charter that enables you to gain authority, support for hiring
and planning, and clear sponsorship.
In this video, you learned that: An organizational structure is how a company
organizes its tasks, allocates resources, and coordinates teams within the organization.
The fundamental principles of building an organizational structure include the project
manager's authority, role, resource availability, budget control, and administration staff.
.
The Project Management Office

Welcome to "The Project Management Office."
After watching this video, you'll be able to:
Define a project management office,
Describe the common functions of project management offices,
And list the three types of project management offices.
One other important role of the PMO is driving accurate documentation.
The PMO works with project managers to see that documentation, such as timelines and
meeting notes, is captured and posted.
When the project is closed, the PMO will review it; if everything is accounted for, it will
archive the project.
PMOs are often responsible for reporting budgets and projects to company leadership.
Project managers may work closely with PMO team members to prepare materials for these
leadership updates.
PMOs keep their eye on the future and the big picture.
They work to identify commonalities so they can be addressed cohesively.
Because the PMO works with so many projects, they can see the big picture and its trends.
They can guide and coordinate the project managers with a high-level perspective that
others may not be able to see.
Of course, no two PMOs will ever be exactly alike, but three common types have emerged:
Supportive: This type exerts a low level of control in decision-making but does provide
best practices, common oversight, and templates.
A supportive PMO shares information and best practices in project management across the
enterprise.
Controlling: This type has some decision-making capabilities but not absolute control.
They often review project managers' work to ensure it meets the organization's practices,
templates, and standards.
A controlling PMO shares information in the same way as a supportive PMO.
Controlling PMOs, however, establish rules for compliance and monitor adherence to those
rules.
Directive: This type leads with a high degree of control over the processes, standards,
templates, reporting, and documentation.
The directive PMO provides information and may also manage compliance.
The most significant difference is the control of resources.
Directive PMOs may manage all project management resources and assign them to projects to meet
the organization's needs.
PMOs can also be layered.
For example, one layer of PMO may provide best practices, templates, and processes,
with a higher-level PMO to govern and report to leadership.
In this video, you learned that: PMOs are responsible for activities that support
project managers at a strategic level.
A PMO standardizes processes, including accurate documentation, and facilitates sharing of
resources.
PMOs can be grouped into three types: supportive, controlling, and directive.
PMOs are much more than just project managers for project managers.
They are essential to an organization and key to reaching its strategic goals.

Expert Viewpoints: The Project Management 
Office

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: The Project Management Office.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing PMOs, or project management offices.
Well, first and foremost, we need to define what a PMO is.
A PMO is a project management office, and a project management office can provide a
multitude of service.
There's different types of project management offices, but all PMOs, those provide one,
two or three of the following services.
Number one, they provide needed guidance and support.
They show you the way.
Number two, they may ensure compliance to policies and procedures.
They try to make sure that everyone is on the same page and everyone is doing it the
right way.
And last but certainly not least, some PMOs may manage project management assignments
to ensure optimal results. In that type of a project management office
if you were a project manager, you would be assigned to the PMO.
How can a PMO be effective in a Organization? The PMO is actually one of the most important 
organizations within an organization.
Imagine a scenario where everybody's doing something different.
There's no consistency.
Nobody knows who to contact.
There's no ownership of a process.
There's no ownership of projects.
That's what it looks like without a PMO.
PMOs bring all of this together.
They create policies, procedures and make sense of the project management world for
non project management practitioners.
It emphasizes the importance of project management and can help remove those roadblocks that
come up as you're working through projects and interfacing with other departments.
It can help the project manager be successful.
A project management organization may have PMs that are responsible for all different
aspects of a project.
Some project managers may be responsible for marketing.
Some project managers may be responsible for development.
Some project managers may be responsible for communication.
Outbound communication or communication with upper management.
And each project manager has to evaluate.
Each project manager has to evaluate what type of management is needed for that area
that they're there managing and they need to run the project that's appropriate for
that area.
So, I think a good PM organization understands those nuances and understands the differences
between, say, marketing and product development and has data and templates that are appropriate
for the project that those project managers are developing.
A PMO can also be just as destructive as it is positive, especially when processes are
overly complicated and very difficult.
Sometimes we'll see that there's hundreds of documentation and you can't find anything
or the documentation is very old and it's not relatable anymore.
It could also go ahead and assist with additional meetings that are not needed.
It's just really making sure that the PMO is right for you and your team.
Some things that can detract from the value of a project management organization many
times for me is just unevenness.
When you have a project management organization where the project managers are of various
skillsets or their expertise is varied and uneven, particularly for the people working
on the team.
When the team can't expect that every project manager is going to be a solid PM, I think
that creates a lot of anxiety on the team and a lot of unevenness in the results of
those projects.
The primary purpose of a good project management office is to serve the needs of the organization's
project managers.
A common joke that I've heard on many occasions is concerning the government.
When a government official comes and looks at you in the eye and says, We're here to
help.
Normally, that's a pretty good laugh line.
Well, unfortunately, that laugh line can hold true for PMOs as well.
When a project management office PMO is perceived as value added and moves the organizational
project management bar upwards, it is indeed value added and perceived as such by the project
managers in the organization.
However, when a project management office becomes adversarial and is looked upon as
a blocker, then the value is reduced.
When you have a manager or stakeholder that doesn't want a PMO to actually be in an organization,
things that you can do to help present and help negotiate to have one would be a of course,
to come with the data be planned as much as possible, come with testimonies, talk about
how you had one at your previous job and how is very beneficial.
Talk about the pros and cons of not having a PMO and what will happen.
Oh, well, just don't walk up to them and say, I've got this great idea.
Let's create a project management office.
The best approach is to perform a root cause analysis of the organization's project management
function as a whole.
Determine what is working, what is not working, what needs to start, what needs to stop, what
needs to stay, and what needs to change.
As part of that root cause analysis, try to determine how creation of a project management
office could potentially help provide needed solutions and propose that this new PMO configure
itself and its duties based on that objective analysis.
Be able to show the data, show what needs to be done, and show how a PMO creation is
the best choice to achieve that goal.
Well, I've been to this process before and it is a challenge, but it isn't impossible,
especially in an organization where project management may not be the priority or seen
as a priority.
And that type of process may not be valued.
And now I want you to understand, it can't be done right away.
It has to be over time.
This isn't something you're going to come in and do in six months or a year or two years.
It's something that you have to gain the favor of management.
So that's the first step, is really getting management to support it.
The second step is showing that value.
And that may be some kind of pilot for a couple of projects.
And then you can start to develop that and put some real strong policies and procedures
around that.
But rolling it out slowly and incrementally is really the best way to approach that.

Traditional Project Management in Action
This article will teach you traditional project management, using an example 
based on "identifying the customer."
The following are aspects of traditional project management:
•	Key project management models
•	Tailoring your project approach
•	Project phases
•	Different types of organizations
•	The PMO
Here is an example of traditional project management in action.
For any project, it is important to identify "Who is the Customer?" Using the traditional waterfall 
approach, let's walk through the process of identifying who the customer is.
You may recall the following phases in a waterfall approach:
•	System and software requirements
•	Analysis
•	Design
•	Coding or Build
•	Testing
•	Operations
This is an example of Company X, which offers the best-selling smartphone. The key features of 
this smartphone are:
•	It is cost-effective,
•	has a good quality camera, 
•	and has a great storage capacity.
With time, the sales of the product started declining. The primary customers of this product include 
the youth. Company X conducted market research to understand the reason for the reduction in 
sales. According to the study, consumers purchase dual-camera phones, while their current 
smartphones lack this feature. Thus, a new version of the smartphone with a dual camera was 
developed.
Traditional PM methodology
The company opted for the Traditional PM approach or the waterfall method to execute this project 
and performed the following steps:
•	System requirements: The project team developed a detailed project plan that included the 
development of the new smartphone's hardware and software components. They also laid 
down a timeline for production and the end product hitting the market. The project team also 
made a broad projection of the cost/price.
•	Design: In this stage, the project team designed the new camera model based on the 
requirements and analysis performed in the previous phases. This stage also included 
prototyping.
•	Engineering: The team developed the camera and integrated it with the phone.
•	Testing: When the product was readied by engineering, the testing team performed a series 
of tests internally before launching the product in the market. For example, they tested the 
camera for functionality, security, performance, and so on.
•	Operations: In the final stage, the new smartphone was launched in the market for users. 
Ongoing maintenance and support were provided to the users.
•	Analysis: The team developed wireframe models, diagrams, and other documentation to 
help the team better understand and design the system requirements.
•	Analysis was made based on the following questions:
•	Which screens will be displayed when the user clicks on a button?
•	What functions/buttons should be on the phone's home page?
•	What navigation buttons and filters will the new camera have?
•	What will be the backend and frontend processes of the camera?
In this scenario, the company identified its core customers and modified its product according to 
their demands. The team completed the project on time by opting for TPM. The company opted for 
the Traditional Project Management approach for the following reasons
•	To provide a clear structure for planning, executing, and monitoring a project.
•	To predict the project's outcome and timeline more accurately.
•	To ensure proper allocation of resources.
•	Also, the Traditional Project Management approach requires documentation at each stage. 
This helped to provide a clear audit trail of the project's progress.
Stacey Diagram Analysis
The Stacey Diagram analysis tool allows decision makers to determine the best approach to 
planning and executing a project. This analysis is based on two parameters:
•	Level of Agreement: Agreement scoring normally is an indicator of how much change you 
can anticipate. The less agreement you have, the more change can be anticipated. Agreement 
scores and complexity can impact the delivery cycles. In most cases, low agreement and 
high complexity levels normally lead to the need to deliver more frequently to ensure you 
are meeting project objectives.
 
•	Technology Complexity: Technology complexity is an indicator of the level of innovation 
that will be needed to plan and execute the project. Evaluation ranges span known 
technology to totally new and unknown technology.
 
The following table presents four scenarios. Using the Stacey Diagram analysis tool, you can see 
how they would likely be evaluated and scored. Note that the total score is calculated by 
multiplying the Agreement Score by the Technology Score.

Module 2 Summary and Highlights: 
Traditional Project Management
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:
•	Projects may be implemented using a predictive or adaptive method. Predictive projects are 
generally called "Waterfall," while adaptive projects are known as "Agile."
•	Many variations of predictive and adaptive projects exist, including Scrum, Six Sigma, 
Lean, etc.
•	The importance of the project phases and following the phases as you manage the project is 
critical. You learned that the Project Management Institute (PMI) developed the most 
common phasing method, which includes initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and 
controlling, and closing.
•	Organizations can impact a project manager's ability to be successful. The primary impact is 
on authority, role, availability of resources, availability of staff, and control of the budget.
•	The value Project Management Office (PMO) adds and that there are three types of PMOs: 
supportive, controlling, and directive.
•	Customers can be internal or external, and they may have a problem to be solved or an 
opportunity to pursue.

The 12 Principles of Project Management

Welcome to "The 12 Principles of Project Management."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe project management principles and Define the key principles listed in
the Project Management Body of Knowledge (or PMBOK) 7th Edition.
Project management principles are the fundamental concepts, practices, and techniques that guide
the effective management of projects. The Project Management Institute (or PMI)
developed 12 principles of project management. These principles are defined
in the PMBOK 7th Edition. Effective project management is based on these
principles, which ensure the success of a project. The 12 principles of project management are:
Being a diligent, respectful, and caring steward; Creating a collaborative project team environment;
Effectively engaging with stakeholders; Focusing on value;
Recognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions;
Demonstrating leadership behaviors; Tailoring based on the context;
Building quality into processes and deliverables; Navigating complexity;
Optimizing risk responses; Embracing adaptability and resiliency; and
Enabling change to achieve the envisioned future state.
The first principle is "being a diligent, respectful, and caring steward."
Stewardship means being entrusted with the care of the project.
It includes responsibilities within and external to an organization.
Stewardship also includes upholding ethics and values.
An effective project manager must perform their duty with certain qualities, which include:
Integrity, Care,
Trustworthiness, and Compliance.
Stewards show an extensive commitment to a project's financial, social,
and environmental aspects. The second principle is "creating
a collaborative project team environment." A project team consists of individuals with
diverse skills, knowledge, and experience. Establishing a culture of respect and
collaboration is essential to accomplish objectives effectively and efficiently.
Team learning and development should be encouraged, which leads
to increased innovation and efficiency. Everyone involved in a project contributes
to achieving the desired outcomes. This helps create a sense of ownership
and commitment among team members. The third principle is "effectively
engaging with stakeholders." A stakeholder is someone who
may affect or be affected by the project. Recognize how stakeholders affect a project,
its performance, and the results. Involve them in an effective manner
and to the extent necessary to contribute to achieving project goals and customer satisfaction.
The fourth principle is "focusing on value."
Value is the ultimate indicator of project success.
It can be financial or non-financial, like goodwill or social benefits.
It can be generated in the course of project execution, at its conclusion,
or after it is finished. Ensure project benefits are
attained by defining the project value, working together, and ensuring the team's success.
The fifth principle is "Recognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions."
A project team must recognize the project as a system.
Like a system, a project has various independent and interacting components.
Systems are ever-evolving and need constant attention to
both internal and external circumstances. Positive outcomes should be facilitated
through responsiveness and teamwork. The sixth principle is "demonstrating
leadership behaviors." A project can be successful
if the leadership demonstrates vision, innovation, motivation, and empathy.
Any member of a project team can demonstrate leadership behavior.
An effective leader has the certain qualities. These include:
Recognizing differences in motivation among team members and projects;
Accepting responsibility for outcomes; Showing respect and fairness
to other team members; and Maintaining integrity and honesty at work.
The seventh principle is "tailoring based on the context."
Each project is unique. The key to a project's success is its ability
to adapt to unique contexts and identify the most effective means of achieving the desired results.
It results in enhanced innovation, efficiency, and productivity.
The next principle is "building quality into processes and deliverables."
Project quality involves satisfying stakeholders' expectations and meeting project requirements.
Project deliverables should comply with the need, application, and acceptability
standards established by the key stakeholders. To attain the required quality, appropriate and
effective project processes must be implemented. Another important project management principle
is "navigating complexity." It means a project manager
must modify their management approach based on the project's complexity level.
Complexity in project management can arise from a number of factors, including:
Human behavior; System behavior;
Ambiguity and uncertainty; and Digital transformation.
Project complexity must be continuously evaluated and managed to complete the project life cycle
The tenth project management principle is "optimizing risk responses."
Risk is an uncertain future event that can affect a project positively or negatively.
Risk management should involve a balance between risk appetite and thresholds.
Risk appetite is the degree of risk a company is ready to take or suffers to achieve its goals.
Risk thresholds are specific levels or points at which a
risk becomes unacceptable and requires a response.
When developing risk management strategies, it is important to consider an organization's risk
appetite and risk thresholds to ensure that risk responses are appropriate.
Embracing adaptability and resiliency is the eleventh principle of project management.
Despite careful planning, unexpected events and changes may occur during a project's life cycle.
Adaptability means being able to adjust to changing circumstances and requirements.
Resiliency means the ability to recover quickly from setbacks, challenges, and failures.
In project management, resiliency means the ability to respond to
unexpected events and continue moving forward. A project manager must create backup plans,
communicate effectively with stakeholders, and maintain flexibility throughout the
project's life cycle in order to incorporate adaptation and resiliency in project management.
The last principle is "enabling change to achieve the envisioned future state."
Every project aims to bring about the change necessary for an organization
to achieve its objectives. Change may be challenging,
though, and resistance to change can be a serious obstacle to a project's success.
A project manager can help achieve the organization's goal and build a better
future state by facilitating change. This requires a combination of strong
leadership, effective communication, and commitment to continuous improvement.
In this video, you learned that: Management principles are the
fundamental concepts, practices, and techniques that guide the effective management of projects.
And the PMBOK defines twelve principles of project management.

Expert Viewpoints: Principles of Project 
Management

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Principles of Project Management.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing the twelve principles of project
management.
Which of the 12 principles, in your opinion, is most critical and why?
Adaptability and resiliency is by far the most critical of the 12 principles.
In my opinion, no matter how much you plan, surprises will always, always pop up.
There could be a major product bug.
Your client has a large volume of feedback that comes last minute that you weren't expecting.
Maybe your creative producer suddenly out sick for a week.
In these stressful situations, your team is likely going to have an emotional reaction.
But it's the role of the project manager to stay calm, reach out to the proper stakeholders
and lead the charge on brainstorming solutions.
The project team should have full confidence that the project manager will communicate
the new plan through the correct channels at the right times.
This puts the whole team at ease and frees them up so they can focus on immediate tasks.
So first, let's address the obvious answer.
All 12 of the principles are important.
However, in the interest of time and brevity, let me choose the two, in my opinion, from
the 12 that really stand out.
Number one, be a diligent, respectful and caring steward.
Hmm.
stewardship involves acting with integrity, caring for the team, being trustworthy and
complying with organizational standards.
A project manager needs to strive for service before self.
If this does not happen, the team will lack trust, competence and team continuity and
effectiveness.
Effectiveness will ultimately suffer.
Secondly, create a collaborative team environment.
Projects are not solely delivered by the project manager alone.
They are delivered by a team.
The team needs to work within organizational and professional guidelines to develop their
own culture.
I would absolutely say a team is the most critical within the 12 principles.
Without a team, you don't have a project.
I'm going to give an example of a recent project that I had over the last couple of years.
We had a great team.
There was definitely some team building opportunities in there, and I had a section of the overall
program.
With that, I was still very new to this type of product and we had a lot of new people
involved.
We didn't know exactly everything that was needed.
However, we did have a team constraint.
We didn't know that at the very beginning until much later on when we ended up missing
a milestone.
And unfortunately, I really don't like failing.
I'm sure nobody else really does either.
But we had the opportunity to take it as a lessons learned, especially since it was the
very beginning of that project.
Again, without a team, you don't have a project.
Is there anything you would add for the 12 principles?
I would add training.
I find education to be extremely important, especially in any sort of circumstances, whether
it's a job outside of work, you want to know as much as possible so you can easily speak
to it and take quick action when needed.
I think the 12 principles as written are highly effective and very comprehensive.
But if I were to add a 13th, I would likely add a new principal to show courage and conviction.
Not every project is perfect.
Create an environment where stakeholders invite what we refer to as functional or good conflict.
Disagree when something doesn't seem right.
Ask questions.
Share opinions openly.
Have the discussion.
A fear of open conflict may leave critical inputs not shared.
These inputs may be the difference between project success and project failure.
I wouldn't add anything to the PMI 12 principles, but I perhaps modify the principle of leadership
to servant leadership.
Project managers should put their egos to the side and find ways to serve the team,
and that can take many forms.
Maybe it's taking the extra time to talk to a frustrated project team member and show
them empathy.
Maybe it's delivering bad news to a client instead of your teammate that just worked
a long shift to try to solve a problem.
It could look like maybe encouraging a quieter teammate to share their opinion in a meeting.
And my favorite of all is celebrating the success of others with leadership.
Project managers are witness to a lot of incredible work that leaders miss because they're just
so busy.
Take an extra 5 minutes and write a quick email and brag about others.
Your team will be so happy you did.
I have a lot of examples of when one or more of the 12 principles of project management
have not been adhered to.
I think there's a combination of two principles that when they're not met, really leads to
a negative experience, and that's when there's poor leadership and when there's poor stakeholder
management.
And both of them, you'll see start bubbling up to the top as an issue if you have a poor
communication plan or a poor communicator as the project lead.
Without clear communication, you're not going to be a good leader and you're not going to
have good stakeholder management.
And the minute that your stakeholders are not behind you on the project whether they're
internal, external, or part of your project team, the work isn't going to get done in
the way that you desire it to be done.
Again, I'm going to turn to case studies that are well-documented in the Project Management
Institute, ww.PMI.org.
The City of Montreal was awarded the honor of hosting the 1976 Olympics.
They set out to build a model set of facilities to support this special event.
Unfortunately, the original and schedule and the original budget were not met.
Many planned facilities were not ready or incomplete when the Games began.
The original budget of 160 million ultimately ended up costing over 430 million.
Every one of the 12 project principles were not adhered to.
Let me go ahead and share two examples.
Number one, the mayor of Montreal assumed project management responsibilities.
This he misrepresented the facts of the project, did not follow proven contracting guidelines,
made deals behind the scene and ultimately lost the trust of the team and city as a whole.
This mayor was a poor steward.
Secondly, the mayor also acted unilaterally and virtually did his own thing.
Team communications were not effective.
The team had no clear direction.
Contributions to solve design problems were totally ignored, and the overall culture of
the project was caustic at best.
The mayor failed to create a collaborative team environment.

The 12 Principles of Project Management: 
Project Scenario
This article will teach you how to apply each project management principle for project success in a 
scenario.
Introduction
Here is a scenario for your consideration. The ABC company sells products and services worldwide. 
It is a customer-centric company and aims to serve its customers efficiently and effectively. To 
achieve this, the company requires a robust IT architecture.
To improve its product offerings, ABC gathers consumer data. It sells this data to make a profit. The 
company recently hired Bev as a project manager to improve the data collection process, security, 
and storage capability.
Objectives
Bev needs to manage the following objectives:
•	Increasing the company's data storage capability by 30%, which will require acquiring more 
hard-disk drives with extra storage capacity.
•	Reducing the risk of data loss by upgrading the existing data backup systems.
•	Strengthening the security system to prevent data breaches; and
•	Increasing the data access speed by 20%.
Bev researches and implements the 12 principles of project management. As a result, all the 
objectives are achieved in the end. The project delivers on time, on budget, and with the desired 
results.
Are you interested to know how Bev's project management principles led to project success?
Application of principles
Application of principles to achieve project success.
Stewardship
The first principle is "being a diligent, respectful, and caring steward." This is how Bev applied this 
principle:
•	In the initial stage of the project, to identify all internal and external stakeholders, Bev 
created a stakeholder register.
•	She clearly defined the importance of the project, the major milestones, and the project goals 
to win the stakeholders' trust and support. She was inclusive in her communication.
•	At the initiating stage, she outlined the project's main financial, social, and technological 
dimensions.
Collaborative team
The second principle is "creating a collaborative project team environment." Bev applied this 
principle by performing these steps:
•	To define goals, assets, and obstacles, Bev developed a team charter, which enabled the 
project team members to establish standards for collaboration.
•	She assessed the essential skill sets of team members and incorporated early training 
programs in the project strategy.
•	She defined each team member's roles and responsibilities clearly and earned support from 
the stakeholders. She also built professional relationships whenever possible.
Stakeholder engagement
The third principle is "effectively engaging with stakeholders." To apply this principle:
•	She analyzed the current and desired levels of commitment from all key stakeholders. She 
developed appropriate strategies to gain what was needed.
•	The way she engaged stakeholders depended on the circumstance.She put much effort into 
learning about each person's goals and adapted her communication accordingly.
Value creation
The fourth principle is "focusing on value." To apply this principle:
•	Bev clearly described the value and advantages of the project in the project charter and 
management plan.
•	She clarified the project's benefits.
•	She tailored "value" to individual and organizational needs, indicating different value 
propositions for different target groups.
Systems thinking
The fifth principle is "recognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions."
Here is how Bev applied this principle:
•	She analyzed the project to identify strong correlations with other projects, programs, and 
the ABC portfolio.
•	She created an influence diagram that indicated external factors that could facilitate or 
hinder the project's progress.
•	She asked SMEs for assistance, asking them to alert her when circumstances changed.
Leadership behavior
The sixth principle is "demonstrating leadership behaviors." Here are the steps Bev took to apply 
this principle:
•	Bev always served as a role model and did not ask the team to do anything she would never 
do.
•	She employed situational leadership by adapting her management style to each unique 
circumstance or task, enabling her team members to meet their needs.
•	She maintained integrity, took responsibility for her actions, and treated everyone with 
respect and fairness.
Tailoring
Here are the steps Bev took to apply the principle of "tailoring based on the context."
•	Bev compared the project to others and understood similarities and differences from other 
projects.
•	The company did not need regular delivery. Bev knew that the rate of change would be rapid 
due to the nature of the project and technological difficulties. She concluded that the project 
would benefit most from implementing the iterative process.
Quality
Bev also implemented the principle of "building quality into processes and deliverables."
•	She created and implemented a quality management plan. The plan established quality 
planning, quality control, and quality assurance processes.
•	All stages of the project followed these processes.
•	The result was quality-simply what the customer and the stakeholders needed from the 
project deliverables.
Complexity navigation
Another important project management principle that Bev implemented is "navigating complexity."
•	She identified and addressed every potential area of uncertainty that could negatively affect 
the project.
•	Through collaboration and planning, she identified problems and created a well-defined 
decision-making system.
Risk response optimization
The tenth project management principle that Bev applied is "optimizing risk responses."
•	She was aware of stakeholder risk appetite and thresholds and made accommodations 
accordingly.
•	She collaborated with the team to identify risks and opportunities, ensuring risk owners were 
allocated and prepared with appropriate remedies.
Adaptability and resiliency
Bev also embraced adaptability and resiliency, the eleventh important principle of project 
management. Here are the steps taken by her.
•	She met with key stakeholders to evaluate changing circumstances and devise solutions 
accordingly.
•	She proactively engaged with stakeholders to absorb shocks and recover swiftly.
•	Bev puts more emphasis on outcomes than outputs.
Change facilitation
Finally, she enabled change to achieve the envisioned future state. Here is how she achieved this:
•	Bev developed and shared an integrated change control process with all stakeholders.
•	As part of this process, she established a Change Control Board (CCB) that analyzed, 
reviewed, approved, or rejected changes. The CCB held weekly meetings
•	She received management support that encouraged all stakeholders to support the process. 
She got her team members to be more accountable for results.
Conclusion
To ensure the success of any project, it is essential to apply project management principles. It is 
possible for organizations to deliver projects on time, within budget, and of high quality when they 
apply these principles. In this article, you learned how to apply each project management principle 
to achieve project success.


Project Failure Overview
This article will teach you about the key knowledge areas of project management and the top three 
steps to perform in these areas.
Introduction
The Project Management Institute (PMI) has identified ten major knowledge areas of project 
management in their PBMKOK Guide, an influential document in project management. Each area 
focuses on a specific aspect of the project, and together they help to complete the project 
successfully.
These knowledge areas include:
•	Project integration management
•	Project scope management
•	Project schedule management
•	Project cost management
•	Project quality management
•	Project resource management
•	Project communication management
•	Project risk management
•	Project procurement management
•	Project stakeholder management
Project integration management 
Project integration management covers all primary activities performed in a project, from project 
initiation to its closure. It helps ensure that different processes or activities performed by different 
resource pools or departments in a project are cohesive and coordinated. This results in a structured 
project life cycle. Here are the steps to apply project integration management:
•	First, develop a project charter at the beginning of the project. 
•	Next, develop a project management strategy as a team. While you proceed, validate and 
obtain approval.
•	Finally, develop and implement an integrated change control process.
Project scope management 
The scope management defines what tasks it will perform in a project. It helps identify what is 
needed and what is not needed to accomplish a project, preventing cost and time overruns. It also 
helps manage changes in the defined scope. Here are the steps to apply project scope management:
•	First, meet customers and design the scope to cover the project's requirements.
•	Next, obtain the support of subject-matter experts.
•	Finally, verify the initial scope with the customers and obtain their approval before you 
proceed.
Project schedule management 
Project schedule management defines tasks and creates a schedule by determining the start and 
finish dates, duration, and resources assigned to each task. It also involves monitoring project 
progress and controlling any changes in the project schedule. Here are the steps to apply project 
schedule management:
•	First, make schedule plans by taking risk into account. Evaluate the most likely, positive and 
negative events.
•	Then, analyze and build dependencies between activities. 
•	Finally, identify the differences between critical paths and critical activities.
Project cost management 
Project cost management includes establishing a budget, keeping track of project expenses, limiting 
expenses, and managing the budget. The objective is to complete the project within the approved 
budget. It involves planning, budgeting, and reporting project spend in order to keep the project 
team on budget and reasonable overall project cost. Here are the steps to apply project cost 
management:
•	First, consider potential risks while estimating costs. 
•	Next, estimate the project's total cost, including direct, indirect, and contingency costs.
•	Finally, track the project's budget effectiveness and address variations.
Project quality management 
Project quality management focuses on planning, executing, and monitoring the project's quality to 
meet the stakeholders' expectations. It helps identify the key metrics which help in assessing the 
quality of the defined product. It combines quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control. 
Here are the steps to apply project quality management:
•	First, establish a quality management plan.
•	Next, conduct a quality assurance audit throughout project execution. 
•	Finally, implement strict quality control checks while generating new deliverables.
Project resource management 
Project resource management involves identifying, acquiring, and managing the resources of a 
project, including personnel, equipment, and materials. It involves creating plans and processes to 
manage these resources effectively. Managing project resources also includes monitoring and 
controlling the resources and their utilization. Here are the steps to apply project resource 
management:
•	First, identify the resources required and their duration early in the project and specify them 
to the functional manager.
•	Next, create a learning environment where the team may develop new abilities.
•	Finally, maintain excellent communication and handle problems as they occur.
Project communication management 
Project communication management involves developing a communication plan that defines the 
communication requirements and meeting schedules and deciding the communication mode for 
daily interactions. It implies timely and appropriate planning, collecting, creating, distributing, 
storing, retrieving, managing, controlling, monitoring, and disposing of project information. Here 
are the steps to apply project communication management:
•	First, develop a communication plan, present it to stakeholders, and seek their support.
•	Next, use the plan to follow the schedule.
•	Finally, ensure changes in the plan are updated and communicated.
Project risk management 
Project risk management involves developing a risk management strategy that outlines classifying 
and prioritizing potential risks. It includes performing both quantitative and qualitative risk 
analyses. It also involves monitoring project development and evaluating the occurrence of risks. 
Here are the steps to apply project risk management:
•	First, create a risk management plan.
•	Next, conduct the qualitative risk analysis. Finally, reevaluate and control risks regularly. 
•	Finally, reevaluate and control risks regularly. Otherwise, they will control you.
Project procurement management 
Project procurement management refers to purchasing or acquiring products or services from 
outside. This knowledge includes creating a procurement management strategy, purchasing, 
managing project transactions, and closing project procurements.
It implies creating and managing relationships with external resources required to complete a 
project, which means communicating with vendors for purchasing, renting, or contracting products 
or services required for achieving project goals. Here are the steps to apply project procurement 
management:
•	First, create a procurement management plan.
•	Next, seek the support of experts in the procurement process.
•	Finally, work closely with vendors.
Project stakeholder management 
Project stakeholder management involves making a list of stakeholders and estimating their impact 
on the project or defining their roles and responsibilities. It also involves implementing strategies to 
gain desired commitment levels from stakeholders. Here are the steps to apply project stakeholder 
management:
•	First, identify stakeholders early in the project stage.
•	Next, manage every stakeholder uniquely.
•	Lastly, if commitment levels are not meeting target levels, revise strategies accordingly.
Conclusion
It's important to remember that depending on the project's size, complexity, and nature, different 
procedures may be necessary for each knowledge area. A few phases might need to be reviewed and 
updated throughout the project's lifespan because the processes might overlap and be iterative.

Project Management in the Virtual 
Environment

Welcome to "Project Management in a Virtual Environment."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe a virtual team; Discuss the pros and cons of a virtual team;
and Explain how to effectively manage virtual teams.
The Project Management Institute (or PMI)
states that a project manager needs to plan communications carefully to realize virtual
team advantages and avoid the disadvantages. But first, what is a virtual team?
A virtual team is a group of people who work together on a project but are geographically
dispersed and communicate using digital tools. The PMI recognizes four main advantages of
a virtual team. A virtual team helps leverage special expertise
from multiple locations. As members may be employed anywhere, the limitation
of using only the local talent pool is removed. A virtual team incorporates employees working
from home This allows more opportunities for working
with employees with disabilities or mobility issues.
Such a team can also employ those unable to travel to the workplace.
A virtual team also can help reduce the price of office space, travel, and other overhead
expenditures that a physical workplace has to bear.
What are some of the disadvantages of a virtual team?
A virtual team depends on the Internet and a computer to accomplish their work.
Due to this, technology-related problems might prevent employees from working from home till the 
problem is fixed.
Because of different time zones, virtual teams
may face challenges in communication and be deprived of face-to-face interactions.
Virtual teams may also struggle with cultural and language differences in addition to different
work styles. Individuals may feel lonely and isolated while
working in virtual worlds and develop trust issues.
Managing a virtual team requires a unique set of abilities.
A project manager must be aware of the "pitfalls" to avoid and the proactive steps to take.
Let's discuss some important points to effectively manage virtual teams.
Projects where geographically dispersed teams adversely impact project management should be 
avoided.
A virtual team's effectiveness is also less
likely to increase due to project complexity. Ensure thorough preparation to mitigate these built-in 
risks.
Create a culture of trust by building relationships
with team members and encouraging collaboration. Team members should be encouraged to share
their ideas and feedback openly. Train your employees and invest in technology.
Provide your team members with the resources and tools they need to operate efficiently.
Also, provide assistance and training for utilizing project management software effectively.
And, ensure that real-time support is available for virtual team members if they encounter problems.
Being consistently accessible to the team
is necessary for a project manager to provide a source of guidance and leadership.
Here's a few more important points. Be inclusive.
Regularly provide information and updates to your virtual team members to overcome any
possible feelings of isolation. Define the project's vision.
Ensure each member is aware of the objectives and advantages of the project.
Develop a team charter outlining the purpose, goals, roles, responsibilities, and expectations
of a team. Ensure roles and responsibilities are clearly
defined and communicated. Leave no questions unanswered.
Note that a virtual teamwork environment requires people to be self-sufficient and self-motivated,
with the support of their virtual team managers. When building your teams, ensure you hire
those who can work and thrive in a remote work setup.
In this video, you learned that: A virtual team is a group of people who work
together on a project but are geographically dispersed and communicate using digital tools;
The advantages of a virtual team include: Expertise from multiple locations
Employees work from home Including employees with disabilities
And saving travel and office expenses. The disadvantages of a virtual team include:
Limited technology available Time zones
Cultural and language difficulties And employees feeling isolated.
Several ways to effectively manage virtual teams including building trust across the
virtual team, investing in technology and training, being inclusive, and more.

Effective Meeting Management


Welcome to "Effective Meeting Management."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Organize and lead effective meetings, Summarize when meetings are required,
And explain the 12 key success factors of effective meeting management.
Meetings are part of everyday project management.
Meetings may be formal, informal, face-to-face, virtual, planned, or impromptu.
Effective meetings are a critical tool project managers use to engage the project team and 
stakeholders, relay information, solve problems, make decisions, and more.
According to the Project Management Institute (or PMI), meetings are a primary means of 
communication throughout a project and using best practices in meeting management help a Project 
Manager be more successful.
Project managers may need to facilitate several types of meetings, depending on the environment.
Several common meeting types exist in a traditional waterfall or predictive lifecycle environment.
Pre-baseline and baseline presentations, Kick-off meetings to gain stakeholder acceptance,
Periodic status meetings, Change management meetings,
Requirements elicitation and analysis meetings, Bidder conferences,
And, Closeout and lessons learned.
In an agile or adaptive environment, a project manager may oversee the following meetings.
Customer requirement meetings, Product backlog refinement, Sprint or iteration planning, 
Daily standup meet, Sprint or iteration reviews, And Retrospectives.
Many managers schedule meetings when they are not required.
Some actions and communications do not require a formal meeting.
The project manager must know when a meeting is the best communication choice.
Here are a few examples of when the manager should schedule a meeting.
When the Information is complex, The team is generating ideas,
Or The team needs to reach a consensus and agree to commitments,
When The team needs to make a decision, The manager wants to build a team,
or when many stakeholders are part of the project.
Meetings are both a science and an art.
A productive meeting can move a project forward, while an unproductive meeting can impact the
project negatively.
Here are 12 key factors to meeting success every project manager should consider.
Always have a measurable outcome.
Each meeting should have a quantifiable goal that all attendees understand.
Develop and share an agenda.
This can be a simple overview of topics in a meeting invite or a formal document.
Send the agenda out 48 hours in advance.
If the agenda had been sent earlier, it would not have become a priority for attendees to
read and review immediately.
Participants may have limited preparation time if the agenda is sent out later.
Communicate the meeting purpose.
Ensure all participants understand the purpose and why they must attend the meeting.
Share materials and prework.
This goes hand in hand with developing and sharing an agenda.
Let participants know preparation expectations.
Allow 48 hours before the meeting to prepare.
Be inclusive.
Try to delegate some meeting topics to others.
Participants will be more committed if they have accountability for the presentation and
results.
Use a parking lot.
Document off-topic discussions on a whiteboard, be polite and let the stakeholder know this
topic, and that a plan for follow-up discussions will be addressed at the end of the meeting.
Enlist the support of a notetaker.
The facilitator should not be responsible for taking notes but should focus on the stakeholders.
Ask a team member to take notes and work together after the meeting to review them.
Assign owners to action items.
Always summarize agreements and commitments.
Review them and ensure stakeholders understand the next steps.
Practice non-attribution.
Create an environment where stakeholders feel comfortable discussing the project openly,
including opinions that may conflict with others.
The facilitator must control conflict to ensure it remains functional or productive.
Publish the notes or minutes.
Document and distribute meeting minutes within 24 hours of the meeting conclusion.
This will reduce the risk of stakeholders not recalling commitments made during the
meeting.
And finally, end early if the meeting objectives are met.
Meet for purpose, not for time.
In this video, you learned that: Meetings are a critical tool a project manager
uses to engage the project team and stakeholders, relay information, solve problems, make 
decisions,
and more.
Some communications do not require a formal meeting,
12 factors to meeting success include: Having measurable outcomes,
Sharing an agenda, Sending the agenda 48 hours before the meeting,
Communicating the purpose of the meeting, Sharing materials and prework 48 hours before
the meeting, Being inclusive and delegate meeting topics
to others, Using a parking lot to park off-topic discussions
until the end of the meeting, Assigning a notetaker,
Assigning owners to action items, Practicing non-attribution to resolve conflict,
Publishing the minutes within 24 hours of the meeting,
And meeting for a purpose, not for time.

Change facilitation
To enable change to achieve the envisioned future state, by developing and sharing an integrated 
change control process with all stakeholders via the creation of a Change Control Board (CCB) that 
analyse, reviewed approve, or reject changes. The CCB held weekly meetings

Project Failure Overview
This article will teach you about the key knowledge areas of project management and the top three 
steps to perform in these areas.
Introduction
The Project Management Institute (PMI) has identified ten major knowledge areas of project 
management in their PBMKOK Guide, an influential document in project management. Each area 
focuses on a specific aspect of the project, and together they help to complete the project 
successfully.
These knowledge areas include:
•	Project integration management
•	Project scope management
•	Project schedule management
•	Project cost management
•	Project quality management
•	Project resource management
•	Project communication management
•	Project risk management
•	Project procurement management
•	Project stakeholder management
Project integration management 
Project integration management covers all primary activities performed in a project, from project 
initiation to its closure. It helps ensure that different processes or activities performed by different 
resource pools or departments in a project are cohesive and coordinated. This results in a structured 
project life cycle. Here are the steps to apply project integration management:
•	First, develop a project charter at the beginning of the project. 
•	Next, develop a project management strategy as a team. While you proceed, validate and 
obtain approval.
•	Finally, develop and implement an integrated change control process.
Project scope management 
The scope management defines what tasks it will perform in a project. It helps identify what is 
needed and what is not needed to accomplish a project, preventing cost and time overruns. It also 
helps manage changes in the defined scope. Here are the steps to apply project scope management:
•	First, meet customers and design the scope to cover the project's requirements.
•	Next, obtain the support of subject-matter experts.
•	Finally, verify the initial scope with the customers and obtain their approval before you 
proceed.
Project schedule management 
Project schedule management defines tasks and creates a schedule by determining the start and 
finish dates, duration, and resources assigned to each task. It also involves monitoring project 
progress and controlling any changes in the project schedule. Here are the steps to apply project 
schedule management:
•	First, make schedule plans by taking risk into account. Evaluate the most likely, positive and 
negative events.
•	Then, analyze and build dependencies between activities. 
•	Finally, identify the differences between critical paths and critical activities.
Project cost management 
Project cost management includes establishing a budget, keeping track of project expenses, limiting 
expenses, and managing the budget. The objective is to complete the project within the approved 
budget. It involves planning, budgeting, and reporting project spend in order to keep the project 
team on budget and reasonable overall project cost. Here are the steps to apply project cost 
management:
•	First, consider potential risks while estimating costs. 
•	Next, estimate the project's total cost, including direct, indirect, and contingency costs.
•	Finally, track the project's budget effectiveness and address variations.
Project quality management 
Project quality management focuses on planning, executing, and monitoring the project's quality to 
meet the stakeholders' expectations. It helps identify the key metrics which help in assessing the 
quality of the defined product. It combines quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control. 
Here are the steps to apply project quality management:
•	First, establish a quality management plan.
•	Next, conduct a quality assurance audit throughout project execution. 
•	Finally, implement strict quality control checks while generating new deliverables.
Project resource management 
Project resource management involves identifying, acquiring, and managing the resources of a 
project, including personnel, equipment, and materials. It involves creating plans and processes to 
manage these resources effectively. Managing project resources also includes monitoring and 
controlling the resources and their utilization. Here are the steps to apply project resource 
management:
•	First, identify the resources required and their duration early in the project and specify them 
to the functional manager.
•	Next, create a learning environment where the team may develop new abilities.
•	Finally, maintain excellent communication and handle problems as they occur.
Project communication management 
Project communication management involves developing a communication plan that defines the 
communication requirements and meeting schedules and deciding the communication mode for 
daily interactions. It implies timely and appropriate planning, collecting, creating, distributing, 
storing, retrieving, managing, controlling, monitoring, and disposing of project information. Here 
are the steps to apply project communication management:
•	First, develop a communication plan, present it to stakeholders, and seek their support.
•	Next, use the plan to follow the schedule.
•	Finally, ensure changes in the plan are updated and communicated.
Project risk management 
Project risk management involves developing a risk management strategy that outlines classifying 
and prioritizing potential risks. It includes performing both quantitative and qualitative risk 
analyses. It also involves monitoring project development and evaluating the occurrence of risks. 
Here are the steps to apply project risk management:
•	First, create a risk management plan.
•	Next, conduct the qualitative risk analysis. Finally, reevaluate and control risks regularly. 
•	Finally, reevaluate and control risks regularly. Otherwise, they will control you.
Project procurement management 
Project procurement management refers to purchasing or acquiring products or services from 
outside. This knowledge includes creating a procurement management strategy, purchasing, 
managing project transactions, and closing project procurements.
It implies creating and managing relationships with external resources required to complete a 
project, which means communicating with vendors for purchasing, renting, or contracting products 
or services required for achieving project goals. Here are the steps to apply project procurement 
management:
•	First, create a procurement management plan.
•	Next, seek the support of experts in the procurement process.
•	Finally, work closely with vendors.
Project stakeholder management 
Project stakeholder management involves making a list of stakeholders and estimating their impact 
on the project or defining their roles and responsibilities. It also involves implementing strategies to 
gain desired commitment levels from stakeholders. Here are the steps to apply project stakeholder 
management:
•	First, identify stakeholders early in the project stage.
•	Next, manage every stakeholder uniquely.
•	Lastly, if commitment levels are not meeting target levels, revise strategies accordingly.
Conclusion
It's important to remember that depending on the project's size, complexity, and nature, different 
procedures may be necessary for each knowledge area. A few phases might need to be reviewed and 
updated throughout the project's lifespan because the processes might overlap and be iterative.

Creating a Meeting Agenda and Minutes
This article will teach you the benefits of meeting agendas and minutes and create meeting agendas 
and minutes with the help of a template.
Meeting agenda 
A meeting agenda is a document that outlines topics and the order in which the project manager will 
discuss them in a meeting. A meeting agenda provides a clear and structured plan for the meeting to 
ensure that all relevant topics are covered promptly and efficiently.
Let us discuss the benefits of specifying a clear agenda.
Benefits of meeting agenda
Benefits of publishing and distributing an agenda:
•	It ensures everyone attending the meeting is informed of the agenda so the meeting runs 
smoothly.
•	It adheres to relevant topics and schedules so unrelated topics or conversations do not divert 
attention.
•	It encourages structured and effective actions to accomplish objectives.
•	It assures the participants that the project manager is implementing an appropriate method.
•	It serves as a guide for the proposed activities in the upcoming stages of the project.
Meeting minutes
Meeting minutes summarize the key points and decisions made during the meeting. They are a 
record of the topics covered, actions proposed, and decisions to be made.
Publishing and distributing meeting minutes have several benefits, including:
•	Minutes help to document and recall essential information. You can document and use 
the facts, see at a glance names of participants, voting patterns, disputes, judgments, and 
other significant information.
•	Meeting minutes are published so that those unable to attend can access the information and 
decisions made, promoting transparency within the group.
•	The participants can make informed decisions and ensure that everyone is informed by 
keeping a record of the discussions and decisions made during the meeting.
•	It provides valuable and informative "takeaways" to the team members.
•	Meeting minutes are reminders to the participants of action to be taken. Minutes can help 
individuals in being more responsible and encourage them to fulfill their commitments.
Important definitions
There are multiple ways to write agendas and meeting minutes. Their format should always be 
professional and include key information. The agenda and minutes templates contain the following 
definitions:
PEI approach
 A project manager can conduct a meeting to achieve one or multiple objectives. Defining the 
objective of the meeting is essential so that participants can come prepared and contribute positively 
to the meeting. Based on its objectives, the manager may use a PEI approach in three types of 
meetings.
•	P stands for persuade. Project managers hold these meetings to bring about agreement, 
permission, and validation. Such a meeting ends with approval or validation. 
•	I stands for informing. Managers conduct these meetings to share information, justify the 
information's release, and ask for feedback to validate its informative value.
•	E stands for entertain. These meetings aim to strengthen the team structure and foster good 
relationships among participants.
The Rule of Three 
It is a powerful technique or principle required for writing or speaking. According to this principle, 
anything given in a group of three is better remembered and effective-including ideas, concepts, 
events, people, and statements. Apply this principle by writing three agendas or dividing the tasks 
into three categories.
Rule 48/24
This rule states that project managers must distribute the agendas to participants 48 hours before the 
meeting. Minutes should be documented and shared within 24 hours after the meeting concludes.
Parking lot
A parking lot is a space left blank for remarks, conversations, or inquiries unrelated to the meeting's 
scope. Putting these off-topic items aside ensures they will be dealt with later. Ideas parked in a 
visual parking lot allow you to pull them into the agenda for another time easily. You can also use it 
to list discussions that could not be conducted in the present meeting.

to list discussions that could not be conducted in the present meeting.
Meeting agenda template
Let us now look at the template to write the meeting agenda. Select the file below to download an 
example of a Meeting Agenda template.
The first step is to state the goal of the meeting. Also, mention the feedback you would like to 
receive after the meeting. The goal of the meeting can be:
•	Persuade
•	Inform
•	Entertain 
The second step is to specify the overview of the meeting. The overview should relate to the 
meeting's specific goals. It specifies the areas discussed in the meeting and the quantifiable results 
you aim to achieve.
Project managers should note that objectives should have value to the attendees.
After specifying the objectives, the next step will be to write the agenda's body. Apply the rule of 
three to ensure all key topics and action items are covered. The elements must operate together. The 
objectives and the aim should be connected in some way. Build the agenda items in the following 
manner for success:
Objective: Responsible Team Members. The expected result of discussions.
For example, Review project budget expenditures. Responsible: Joy, Sandy, Aman, and Priya. 
Result:  Show planned versus actual expenditures to date. Provide recommendations and comments.
The last step will be to write the summary. Include the following elements in the summary:
•	Review your accomplishments and shortcomings.
•	Discuss future actions.
•	Request feedback or a synopsis of everyone's "Takeaways."
Here are a few points:
•	Ensure that everyone in the meeting has a role. Participants need not be present if they have 
no responsibility. You can send minutes to them instead. 
•	Each participant should summarize their key learnings. Never presume a team member 
understands or accepts responsibility for a task unless they clearly state what they do.
•	Use a "Parking Lot" to stay on track. If a member wants to discuss something not on the 
agenda, note that in the parking lot and discuss it later.
•	Follow the 48/24 Rule. Post the schedule 48 hours before the event. Minutes are published 
24 hours after the meeting.
Meeting minute template
A Meeting Minute Template is a document that records the key points and decisions made during a 
meeting. Select the file below to download an example of a Meeting Minute Template.
•	A Meeting Minute Template includes the following elements:
•	Date and subject of the meeting: Mention the meeting's date and briefly overview the main 
topics covered.
•	A list of those who attended the meeting.
•	The following are the meeting's quantifiable goals:
•	List the items in the "Parking Lot." Also, add a plan to address them.
•	Key Commitments and Next Steps: List key action items and validate commitment from 
stakeholders. End with the next steps.
Conclusion
In this article, you learned about the meeting agenda and meeting minutes. You also learned how to 
create templates for meeting agendas and meeting minutes.

Influencing for Results

PMI suggests creating a team charter to establish ground rules and conventions that direct the team.
Provide guidance to members whenever they need it. The management strategy known as
"Management by Wandering About" (MBWA) involves the manager spending time talking to and 
watching
the employees while they are at work. Finally, feedback is crucial to growth.
Discuss what works well and what needs improvement.
Set goals while cooperating with the team. Team members should get the chance
to develop their talents. In this video, you learned that:
Effective influencing abilities and behaviors allow individuals to convince and encourage
others to follow a desired course of action. And five common aspects essential to team
development include: Objective awareness
Early role assignments Project team operations
Guidance Feedback


The first model is Theories X, Y, and Z.
These are three different approaches to understanding employee motivation and management styles,
which can impact effective influencing.
Theory X was proposed by Douglas McGregor.
This theory assumes that employees are motivated primarily by self-interest, which is essentially
a desire to increase earnings with the least amount of work.
Therefore managers use financial incentives and punishments as the primary drivers of
employee behavior.
Such team members can be influenced by using a hands-on and top-down management approach.
Theory Y, which was also proposed by Douglas McGregor, says employees genuinely want to
work, enjoy their jobs and are innovative and creative.Such team members can be influenced
by using a personal coaching style.
It also encourages discussion and innovation and helps to create a positive work environment.
Theory Z assumes that employees are motivated by a sense of community and a shared sense
of purpose.
If a manager holds a Theory Z mindset, he is more likely to prioritize team-building,
collaboration, and open communication to influence the employees.
This effective approach can create a strong sense of connection and commitment to the
organization.
The Drexler/Sibbet Team Performance Model or 7-Step Team Performance Model is a framework
that describes the stages of team development and provides instructions on how to proceed
through each phase successfully.
This model has 7 stages that are divided into two groups: creating stages and sustaining
stages.
The Creating Stages include the four initial stages of group development.
They focus on establishing the team's purpose, building relationships, and clarifying goals.
They are: Orientation,
Trust building, Goal clarification and
Commitment.
The Sustaining Stages start after the group has adjusted and established itself.
During this stage, they identify and share actions for enhancing sustainability and performance
in the team.
And these last 3 steps include: Implementation,
High performance, and Renewal
The first step, orientation, answers the question, "why am I here?"
The team needs to understand its purpose and what being a member means.
The second step is the trust-building stage.
It answers questions related to "who"?
Team members work together to create trust and establish open communication.
They learn about each other's strengths and weaknesses and begin to rely on one another
to achieve goals.
The third step answers the question "What are we doing?" and gives goal clarification.
The team defines its goals and decides how it will evaluate success.
The main focus is on setting clear and quantifiable goals based on the stakeholders' expectations
and requirements.
The fourth step is commitment.
It answers questions related to "How will we do it?"
The team decides how exactly it will reach its objectives by discussing particular courses
of action, deciding how to distribute resources, and defining each member's responsibilities.
The fifth step, implementation, involves sequencing and scheduling tasks.
The team asks itself questions like "who does what?", "when?" and "where?
The team executes its plan, and members work together to complete tasks and achieve goals.
The next step is high performance.
A team enters the high-performance stage when it has mastered its operations and can adapt
to changes and achieve its objectives.
Now, the team members work together and require minimal oversight.
There is a sense of shared ownership and accountability for achieving goals.
The seventh and final step of the 7-Step Team Performance Model is renewal.
As the team reaches the end of its journey, they reflect on their accomplishments and
learn from the experiences.
Team cohesion is evaluated at this stage, and required changes are made.
New members could also be employed.
The third model is the Influence Diagram.
This diagram is a graphical representation of the factors involved in making decisions.
It represents and analyzes the factors that motivate or demotivate decision-making.
The diagram can be used by a team or individually.
An Influence Diagram shows the factors for increasing and reducing influence.
Factors that reduce influence are: Poor communications,
Poor issues management, Limited growth opportunities,
And Lack of project vision Factors that increase influence are:
Building relationships, Being accessible,
Building trust, And Active listening.
In this video, you learned that: The PMI defines the following methods for
influencing stakeholders: Theory X, Y, Z,
The 7-Step Team Performance Model, and The Influence Diagram
Theory X, Y, Z is made up of three approaches to understand employee motivation and management
styles, The 7-Step Team Performance Model is a framework
that describes the stages of team development, And the Influence Diagram is a graphical 
representation
of the factors involved in decision-making.


Leading Change
Welcome to "Leading Change."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe elements of change management, and Explain the three common change models.
Change happens in all projects.
It can affect systems, behaviors, activities, business requirements, and culture.
The project manager and team must know how to manage change.
According to the Project Management Institute (or PMI), change management consists of five
interrelated elements, including: formulating change,
planning change, implementing change,
managing the transition, and sustaining change.
The first element is formulating change, where the project manager communicates the value
and purpose of the change.
The second element is planning the change.
The project manager identifies and plans any changed project operations.
Planning eases a stakeholders' transition, especially if they are involved in the delivery.
In the implementing change element, the project manager must identify potential problems and
fix them.
This includes requesting feedback from the team and making the required changes to keep
the project on track.
The next element, managing transitions, addresses issues during the project's transition from
the present to future conditions.
The project manager must fix unresolved issues to achieve the desired state.
The last element is sustaining change.
Now the project manager must see that the change is sustained in the future state.
And if not sustained, what needs to be fixed.
Organizations can choose from several models to plan and implement change effectively.
Commonly used models are the ADKAR model,
the Kotter Change model, and the Bridges Transition Model.
The ADKAR model is outcome-oriented.
It outlines specific objectives that provide long-lasting effects.
The ADKAR model consists of five stages: Awareness,
Desire, Knowledge,
Ability, and Reinforcement.
The first step is creating awareness of the need for change.
The project manager explains why the change is necessary, what it will entail, and its
impact on the team.
The second stage involves explaining the benefits and risks of the change.
In the third stage, the team receives training and knowledge of how to change by discussing
roles and responsibilities, innovative techniques, and procedures.
In the fourth stage, anyone who needs help with the change will receive resources, tools,
and support.
In the last stage, the project manager reinforces change by adding incentives, kudos, criticism,
and assessment to promote the winning situation and sustain the transition successfully.
The Kotter change model, introduced by John Kotter, is an eight-step process for successfully
implementing organizational change.
In this top-down approach, the need originates at the organization's top.
The model has eight steps: Create a sense of urgency
Form a powerful coalition Create a vision for the change
Communicate the vision Remove obstacles
Create short-term wins Build on the change and
Anchor the changes in corporate culture.
First, establish a sense of urgency for the change among managers and employees.
Ask for their input on what is driving the need for change.
You must identify potential threats or opportunities driving the need for change.
Also, it is essential to share the value proposition.
Next, create a powerful coalition by building a capable team with the necessary abilities,
qualifications, reputation, connections, and authority to lead the change activities and
influence stakeholders.
In the third step, all stakeholders must share a clear and compelling vision for the change,
consistent with the organization's values and goals.
In the fourth step, you communicate the vision and the strategies to inspire the rest of
the company to accept and support changes.
There may be challenges in implementing this organizational transformation.
Next, remove obstacles like inadequate processes, employee reluctance to change, supervisors
who lack authority, corporate policies, and structure.
In the sixth step, short-term targets that the team can achieve are set.
This is critical to maintaining momentum and inspiring employees to support the initiative.
Recognize small victories to enhance confidence, maintain momentum and spread excitement 
throughout
the company.
Next is to build on the change.
While the team is celebrating their short-term wins from step six, more challenging goals
should be pursued to continue improvement.
Finally, the last step anchors the changes in corporate culture.
The leaders must cultivate the new culture to sustain change by sharing the vision and
success stories with everyone.
And the last model commonly used to plan and implement change effectively, the Bridges
Transition Model by William Bridges, helps individuals understand and manage a transition's
emotional and psychological aspects.
The three stages an individual experiences during change are
ending, losing, and letting go, the neutral zone,
and the new beginning.
In the ending, losing, and letting go stage, individuals acknowledge their losses and learn
to cope by deciding what they will preserve or lose.
The experience could cause sadness, loss, or relief.
The second stage is the neutral zone.
In this transitional period, individuals have not yet adjusted to the new situation.
Some individual's productivity may drop during this stage due to continued frustration
or confusion, while others will grow as they open to new possibilities.
The third and final stage is the new beginning.
Individuals have adjusted to change and are moving forward.
They may feel a sense of accomplishment and optimism in taking on new challenges and 
opportunities.
In this video, you learned that: Change can affect systems, behaviors, activities,
business requirements, and culture.
The PMI's five interrelated elements of change include:
Formulating change, Planning change,
Implementing change, Managing the transition, and
Sustaining change.
Three commonly used models to implement change include:
The ADKAR Model, The Kotter Change Model, and
The Bridges Transition Model
Managing Quality


Welcome to "Managing Quality."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define the PMI project management quality process.
Differentiate between Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC).
And, discuss tools and techniques used in quality management.
Project quality management ensures that the deliverables are valuable and conform to requirements.
It requires careful planning and execution to accomplish this.
The Project Management Body of Knowledge 7th edition (or, PMBOK7) breaks out the costs of 
quality into two categories: costs of compliance and costs of non-compliance.
The project manager must weigh the costs of investing in project quality against the benefits.
Compliance costs abide by the laws, rules, and regulations issued by regulatory bodies, 
governments, or industry standards.
There are two categories of compliance costs: Prevention costs, and Appraisal costs.
Prevention costs include expenses to prevent defects.
Prevention costs also include: Product or service requirements, Quality planning, Quality assurance, 
and Training.
Appraisal costs evaluate the degree of compliance.
Appraisal costs include these expenses: Verification, Quality audits, and Supplier assessments and 
ratings.
Non-Compliance costs do not obey laws, rules, or industry standards.
These expenses can be internal or external failures.
Internal failure includes expenses to find and correct defects before delivering the final product.
Internal failure costs are: Waste, Scrap, Reworks, and Failure analysis External failure expenses 
happen after the product is delivered.
They are: Repairs and servicing, Warranty claims, Complaints, Returns, and Reputation
Project quality management is a straight-forward, three-step approach.
Plan Quality management, Manage quality, and Control quality Planning Quality Management is a 
process that determines the project's requirements, standards, and procedures to attain the desired 
quality.
It also develops a quality management plan.
The Quality Assurance (or QA) stage puts the quality management plan into practice, and ensures 
that the project conforms to standards, policies, and procedures.
It employs quality audits to prevent issues from arising.
Throughout the project, Quality Control (or QC) monitors project outcomes to make sure they meet 
the quality standards.
QC identifies problems in the product or service and addresses them before they affect final 
delivery.
Quality Control examines the product's or service's completeness, compliance, and suitability for 
use.
So, how do you differentiate between QA and QC?
QA is a preventative process, but QC is a corrective process.
QA is a proactive process before production or delivery.
QC is a reactive process during or after production or delivery.
And, QA focuses on improvement and process optimization, while QC focuses on finding and 
fixing defects.
Some tools and techniques commonly used in quality management to improve the quality of 
products or services include: Affinity diagrams, Histograms, Cause and effect diagrams,
Scatter diagrams, Designing for X, SIPOC Diagrams, Flow charts, Mind mapping, Logical data 
models, and Matrix diagrams.
First, the affinity diagram.
An affinity diagram organizes and classifies large amounts of data or ideas collected through 
brainstorming sessions.
Then, the ideas are grouped based on relationships and similarities.
A Histogram is a bar chart depicting a variables' distribution over time.
It represents the distribution by mean.
Histograms are commonly used in Quality Management to evaluate and improve processes, identify
areas of variation, and track performance over time.
Cause-and-effect diagrams show the relationship between the results and root causes of problems.
The Ishikawa diagram, named after its creator, Japanese quality control expert Kaoru Ishikawa, is 
also known as the fishbone diagram, since it's structure resembles a fish, with the problem or effect 
being the "head" of the fish and the potential causes represented as the "bones."
Scatter diagrams discover patterns and trends in data to show the strength and direction of a 
relationship between two variables.
In this illustration of two statistically independent variables, the two variables are plotted along two 
axes, and the pattern of the resulting points reveal the correlation.
The Design for X, or "Design for Excellence," lays out guidelines for reaching a product's 
objectives.
It reviews and improves the new product and process design before manufacturing.
SIPOC stands for Suppliers, Inputs, Processes, Outputs, and Customers.
A SIPOC diagram, a six-sigma tool, identifies the critical elements of a process, defines its 
boundaries, and determines the stakeholders involved.
A flowchart visually represents the sequence of steps and decisions needed.
The diagram includes notes for each step.
Steps are linked by connecting lines and directional arrows.
The Logical Data Model is used to identify the areas where quality issues arise.
It identifies potential solutions.
Mind maps record and arrange concepts and data systematically.
They involve creating a diagram representing the main idea or topic in the center, with related ideas 
branching out hierarchically.
Matrix diagrams visualize complex relationships.
They help identify how different elements in a project interact and depend on one another.
In a table format, rows and columns represent different categories or dimensions.
The intersections of these rows and columns describe the relationship between the categories.
In this video, you learned that: Project quality management ensures that deliverables are valuable 
and conform to quality requirements.
The PMBOK7 breaks down the costs of quality into two categories:
Compliance costs, which abide by the laws, rules and regulations issued by regulatory bodies, 
governments, or industry standards, and Non-compliance costs which do not obey laws, rules or 
industry standards.
The project quality management three-step approach includes:
Planning quality management, Managing quality, and Controlling quality.
QA is a preventative, proactive process which identifies and prevents potential defects in a project 
whereas QC is a corrective, reactive process which identifies weaknesses in a project to take 
corrective action.
Tools and techniques that managers use in quality management include:
Affinity diagrams, Histograms,
Cause and effect diagrams, Scatter diagrams,
Designing for X, SIPOC Diagrams,
Flow charts, Mind mapping,
Logical data models, And Matrix diagrams.

Stakeholder Register

Welcome to "Stakeholder Register."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
• Explain a stakeholder register, and • Describe what a stakeholder register includes.
In order to understand what a stakeholder register is, one needs to know what stakeholders
are.
One of the key goals of the project initiation phase is to identify those who need to be
part of the project.
It means identifying the core team, sponsors, department directors, Subject Matter Experts
(SME), customers, operations, and other key roles.
These people are called stakeholders.
They are an important part of a project as they provide the support necessary for the
project to succeed.
Their decisions play a vital role in the project's success.
There are several advantages to identifying stakeholders early in a project.
• Stakeholders must be aware of the project to be able to assist in or contribute to project
management later.
They should be given prior notice so that they can plan their participation.
• Before committing to support, stakeholders must be aware of their roles and obligations,
which must be understood, successfully conveyed, and assigned.
• In some cases, stakeholders might be unable to provide the required support for a project.
A project manager, in this case, must identify potential gaps in support and act quickly
to resolve problems.
• There can be a need for further training due to inadequate skill levels or workforce
crisis.
A project manager needs to address these problems.
• Effective communication is essential to manage a project successfully.
Lists of stakeholders who need to communicate are available in a stakeholder register.
A stakeholder register is a document that lists all the stakeholders associated with
a project, along with relevant information about each of them.
This information may be used to monitor and manage stakeholder expectations throughout
the project life cycle.
A stakeholder register includes certain columns.
Some of these include: Name or Position, which implies the name or
position of each stakeholder.
Organization, which implies the department or organization that the stakeholder is associated
with and is a column that can be deleted or left blank if it doesn't apply.
The role, which implies an accurate, brief, and clear explanation of a stakeholder's
role.
And RACI, which is a responsibility-defining matrix and stands for Responsible, Accountable,
Consulted, and Informed.
For successful project management, it is important that everyone involved in a project understands
their role and responsibilities.
This can be achieved through a RACI chart.
It defines the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders in a project.
The four roles that RACI defines include the following:
• Responsible, which means the person is in charge of performing the work or producing
the desired outcome.
• Accountable, which means the person is responsible for the task or result and makes
the final decision about its accomplishment.
• Consulted, which means the person is consulted but not authorized to make decisions, and
• Informed, which means the person is kept informed of progress and results but is neither
consulted nor responsible for the task or result.
There are a few more important points to consider regarding the stakeholder register.
• A single stakeholder may have one or multiple RACI designators.
• It's not necessary to name every stakeholder.
For instance, seven marketing personnel will be working on a project, and you need help
with marketing.
Choose a single liaison that can assist the marketing team as a whole.
If more than one entry is needed, try to functionally group as many members of the marketing team.
• It is not important to list every member of a project team.
The addition of core team members actively engaged in project planning is necessary.
• A stakeholder register is an evolving document and expands as the project progresses.
Maintaining a stakeholder register up to date and using version control is important.
It may be helpful to look at an example of the stakeholder register format.
In this register are the names of the different stakeholders, their organizations, and their
roles in the project.
You can also view the task they are required to perform.
In this video, you learned that: • A stakeholder is anyone who needs to be
a part of a project.
• A stakeholder register is a document that lists stakeholders associated with a project,
• This register includes the stakeholder's name, organization, role, and RACI,
• A stakeholder may have one or multiple RACI designators,
• Not every stakeholder needs to be named, • Not every member of a project team needs
to be listed, • And the stakeholder register is ever evolving.

Decision Making

Welcome to "Decision Making."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the importance of effective decision-making.
And identify various methods used to make effective decisions.
Effective decision-making means making informed, timely, and well-considered decisions that
support the successful completion of a project.
Effective decision-making in project management can lead to better project outcomes, improved
teamwork and stakeholder relations, and more informed and effective resource allocation.
According to the Project Management Institute (or PMI), a project manager should seek "expert
judgment" while making an important decision instead of making a unilateral decision.
Involving experts in the decision-making process improves the chances of project success and
increases stakeholder confidence in the process and outcome.
A project manager should handle group discussions carefully, as they have pros and cons.
In group discussions, team members are more likely to feel involved in decisions they
have helped design, which can enhance their buy-in and commitment.
However, it can be a time-consuming process, which may result in lengthy discussions and
debates.
As per the PMI, a project manager should pursue team decision-making more often.
Each team member can share their ideas, and the group works collaboratively to arrive
at a decision.
A project manager should encourage participation from all stakeholders and acknowledge their
contribution.
However, the project manager is ultimately accountable and should try to make project
decisions as early as possible.
A project manager and team members must understand each decision's importance and nature and
adopt an optimal approach to ensure a successful outcome.
The PMI has documented a few important methods for making effective decisions.
These include:
Voting,
Fist-to-Five,
Nominal group technique (or NGT),
Autocratic,
Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (or MCDA), and
Wideband Delphi.
Voting is a popular method for collective decision-making.
It can help make decisions effectively in certain situations by allowing democratic
participation and representation.
However, it can also lead to conformity as sometimes participants feel pressured to choose
what the rest of the group wants them to do.
There are three ways to determine a voting result.
Unanimity involves 100% support for the decision path from the voting members.
The Majority, which involves more than 50% support for the decision path from the voting
members.
And Plurality indicates the largest group determining the decision path.
It is possible to have a plurality of opinions, resulting in a decision made by less than
50% of the group.
Fist-to-Five is a quick way to collect user input in a group or to determine general agreement.
The leader restates a course of action and requests that the others express their level
of support by putting up several fingers ranging from 0 to 5.
Five represents a complete agreement, whereas clenching your fist indicates strong disagreement.
After indicating their support levels, the group can quickly see where most of the support
lies and decide based on that.
The Nominal Group Technique (or NGT) is a systematic approach to group brainstorming
that promotes contributions from all participants and allows speedy agreement on the relative
importance of topics, problems, or solutions.
Team members begin by writing down their ideas and selecting which is best.
After team members are ready, everyone presents their favorite idea, and the group discusses
and prioritizes the suggestions using a point system.
An autocratic leadership style is one in which a single individual, usually a manager or
leader, makes all the decisions without seeking input from others.
Autocratic decision-making is most effective when the leader clearly understands the situation
and needs to decide and act quickly.
Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (or MCDA) is a weighted decision-making method that
involves choosing between options when multiple criteria (or objectives) are available for
consideration.
It helps ensure that decisions involve systematic and objective evaluation of the available
options.
This example compares two providers on several variables, including pricing, capacity, delivery,
competence, and reputation.
The last method recommended by the PMI is Wideband Delphi.
This method is employed when a decision needs to remain confidential.
The project manager facilitates this method.
The method is used when participants hesitate to voice their ideas publicly or for the widely
dispersed team.
Here is an overview of the process:
Step 1: The facilitator presents the problem to the concerned team in a group or individually.
Step 2: Participants present their ideas or solutions through their choice of communication,
like posts, emails, or text messages.
Step 3: The facilitator collects the feedback and tabulates the results.
Step 4: The results are declared, but the identification of the participants and votes
are kept confidential.
Another helpful method to make effective decisions is the Owner, Approver, Reviewers, and 
Participants
(or OARP) method.
Although not documented by PMI, this is a useful technique for making effective decisions.
It is a structured process of making decisions that involve uncertainty.
Note that the actual process steps arrange the acronym to be O-P-R-A.
There are four steps in the OARP method.
Step 1: The "owner" of the decision, often the project manager, identifies the issue,
the opportunity, and the action required.
Step 2: The "participants" and the owner discuss the decision-making process.
Participants are often the decision-making stakeholders who will be most affected and
may include operators, end users, consumers, technical support staff, or other individuals.
Step 3: The "reviewers," a group of stakeholders who are often managers of the participants,
work with owners to review decision criteria and participant input.
Reviewers develop opinions they believe are not feasible for moving forward.
Step 4: The "approver" is usually the sponsor in a project environment and reviews
proposed options and makes a final decision.
This decision is relayed to the owner for communication and execution.
In this video, you learned that:
Effective decision-making means making informed, timely, and well-considered decisions that
can lead to:
Better project outcomes
Improved teamwork and stakeholder relations
And informed resource allocation
Methods used to make effective decisions include:
Voting
Fist-to-Five
Nominal Group Technique (or NGT)
Autocratic
Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (or MCDA)
And Wideband Delphi .

Stakeholder Engagement Plan

Welcome to "Stakeholder Engagement Plan."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define a stakeholder engagement plan (or SEP)
and its importance, and Describe how to create an SEP matrix.
A stakeholder engagement plan (or SEP) is a formal document that outlines the strategy
to communicate with stakeholders interested in a project.
An SEP identifies stakeholders, and their interest levels, power, and influence.
It is continuously updated to meet stakeholder needs.
The goal of an SEP is to achieve the level of stakeholder commitment required to properly plan and 
execute a project.
Note that this is a plan held close to one's vest.
Only the core project team has access to this plan.
After the project charter is authorized, this
is the first finished plan.
An SEP consists of:
The names of important stakeholders whose commitment to the project is crucial,
The Current State mentioning the level of commitment at present,
The Desired State mentioning the level of commitment that is ideal and required,
And the Strategy needed to move stakeholder commitment from the present state to the desired one.
The SEP matrix is a tool to identify the level
of engagement required of each stakeholder group, based on their level of interest and
influence in the project. The matrix identifies five distinct levels
of commitment designators: Unaware, which indicates that the stakeholder
is unaware of the project and its impacts; Neutral, which indicates that the stakeholder
is aware of the project but has not determined the level of support they need to extend;
Resistant, which indicates that the stakeholder does not support the project and is resistant to 
change;
Supportive, which indicates that the stakeholder
supports the project and is supportive of change; and
Leading, which indicates that the stakeholder is supportive and actively engaged in ensuring the 
project is a success.
Consider the following scenario to understand an SEP better.
John is managing a business application development project.
In this project, Rahul is the sponsor and
is quite supportive of the project.
Mary is the customer and is not sure whether she agrees with the project.
Ram is the Subject Matter Expert (or SME) who does not support the project and thinks the project 
is a waste of time.
Evan is an Information Technology (or IT) professional and supports the project.
And John wants Evan to perform some tasks related to the project.
Shown here is the SEP matrix that clearly defines the roles of all the stakeholders,
along with a strategy to involve them actively for project success.
In this video, you learned that: The stakeholder engagement plan (or SEP) is
a document that includes: Project stakeholder names
Current State, which indicates the stakeholder's present commitment level,
Desired State, which indicates the stakeholder's ideal commitment level,
And the Strategy the manager needs to move the stakeholder from the Current to Desired State.
The SEP matrix is a tool project managers
use to identify the level of engagement required of each stakeholder group.


Key Financial Metrics


Welcome to "Key Financial Metrics."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the importance of financial metrics, and
Define some key financial metrics to determine a project's efficiency.
Financial metrics are quantitative indicators that evaluate a company's financial performance
and stability.
These indicators assist investors and analysts to study data on various aspects of a company,
including its revenue production, profitability, and financial stability.
A project manager should know some key financial metrics, such as:
Opportunity cost,
Time value of money, and
Depreciation.
Opportunity costs are the possible benefits that a person, investor, or company forgoes
while deciding between two options.
This concept addresses project tradeoffs.
For example, the value of Project A is $60,000, and Project B's value is $40,000.
You can only choose one project, so you select Project B.
By doing so you "lose" the chance to benefit from Project A's worth.
Therefore, choosing Project B has an opportunity cost of $60,000.
In the case of multiple projects, the opportunity cost is always the value of the highest-valued
project not chosen.
Twenty years ago, $100 could buy more than what it does today.
So, some financial calculations consider the time value of money.
The time value of money is a concept stating that the value of a currency decreases over
time.
However, the value of the currency increases if we invest the money.
Invested money earns a return, creating a more significant amount of money in the future.
Depreciation determines an asset's value loss over time because of regular wear and
tear, aging, and technological advancements.
The devaluation of assets allows an organization to reduce its taxes and claim the lost value
of the investment.
There are two methods of calculating depreciation:
The Straight-line method, and
Accelerated depreciation.
The simplest method of calculating depreciation is the straight-line method.
The amount of depreciation subtracted from an asset's value is same for every year
of its life.
If an asset is worth $100,000 and depreciates by $20,000 annually over five years,in order
to calculate annual deduction, divide the asset's value by its useful life.
The accelerated depreciation method allocates a higher portion of an asset's cost in the
early years of its life as compared to later years.
This approach considers that assets are often more productive in their early years than
later years.
The accelerated depreciation method includes:
Double Declining Balance, and
The sum of the years' digits.
You will not need to know these depreciation calculations for the CAPM testing.
Some additional financial metrics that influence the choice of projects are:
Payback,
Return on investment,
Return on invested capital (ROIC),
Benefit-cost ratio (BCR),
Economic value added (EVA),
Internal rate of return (IRR), and
Net present value.
The payback period is the time required to recover the initial cost of an investment.
It is the break-even point at which the total investment equals the total revenue.
The payback period equals the initial investment divided by the periodic cash flow.
The Return on investment (ROI) is a metric that tells us an investment's profitability.
It determines the amount of investment return concerning the cost of the investment.
ROI equals the net profit divided by the investment cost and multiplied by 100.
The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) determines how well a company allocates capital to 
profitable
projects or investments.
It calculates the returns a company generates for every dollar invested in it.
ROIC equals the Net Operating Profit After Taxes (NOPAT) divided by the invested capital
and multiplied by 100.
For example, in a project where the investment is $100,000, and the first-year returns are
$10,000, the ROIC will be 10%.
The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is a technique to compare the benefits of a project with
its costs.
A BCR that is more significant than 1 indicates a profitable project.
BCR is equal to the total benefits divided by the total costs.
For example, in a project where the total benefits are $10,000 and the total costs are
$8,000, the BCR will be 1.25.
The Economic Value Added (EVA) measures the value a company generates for its shareholders.
This concept suggests that projects should provide returns beyond their cost of capital.
When shareholders generate more wealth, profitability increases.
The net present value (NVP) is the difference between the present value of your cash inflows
and the present value of your cash outflows over a period.
The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the net present
value (NPV) of a project zero.
In order to calculate the IRR, the discount rate must be determined so that the present
value of future cash flows equals the cost of initial investment.
The IRR compares the efficiency of different investments and determines
a project's profitability.
Finally, the Net Present Value (NPV) is the difference between the present value
of your cash inflows and the present value of your cash outflows over a period.
To calculate NPV you need to use a cash flow chart - like an IRR cash flow chart
and select a discount rate for devaluing returns.
NPV provides the dollar value.
The following scenario demonstrates how to use financial calculations to determine project
benefits
A project has an investment valued at $100,000 and an annual return of $50,000.
The payback is the break-even point at which the total investment equals the total revenue,
which, in this case, is two years.
The ROI is 50%.
The IRR is 23.38%.
And the NPV is $22,130.
Note: the IRR and NPV of the project were calculated using a formula in Microsoft Excel.
In this video, you learned that:
Financial metrics are quantitative indicators that evaluate a company's financial performance
and stability.
Key financial metrics project managers use include:
Opportunity cost,
Time value of money,
Depreciation,
Payback,
Return on investment (or ROI,
Return on invested capital (or ROIC),
Benefit-cost ration (or BCR),
Economic value added (or EVA),
Internal rate of return (or IRR), and
Net present value (or NVP).

Welcome to "Project Budgets."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define budget levels of accuracy, Summarize budget estimation models, and
Discuss key project budget considerations.
A budget estimate approximates the time and resources required to plan and complete a
project.
Budget estimates are essential for planning and decision-making, as they provide a framework
for allocating resources and managing costs.
There are two levels of budget estimates: Level 1 is Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM),
and Level 2 is definitive estimate.
The project manager includes a Rough Order of Magnitude (or ROM) estimate in the project
charter.
It provides decision-makers with a broad parameter to determine if best- and worst-case budget
estimate limits are acceptable.
A ROM estimate is -25% to +75%.
For example, a ROM for a $100,000 budget estimate might range from $75,000 to $175,000.
The definitive estimate level is the most exact estimate, which the team determines
after completing all project planning.
This level of budget estimation generally serves as the boundaries a budget needs to
conform with before the project close.
A definitive estimate is -5% to +10%.
For example, a definitive estimate for a $100,000 budget might range from $95,000 to $110,000.
You may wonder why there is an under-budget threshold.
If a project ends under budget, the unused funds are returned to the organization.
However, those unused funds sat idle throughout the project and were not providing a return
on investment.
Zero percent returns lose value due to inflation.
If possible, a project manager and team should avoid being over and dramatically under budget.
There are several estimation models project managers use to determine project costs.
A project budget generally uses multiple models based on the cost categories under analysis.
These estimation models include analogous, parametric, and bottom-up.
With the analogous estimation model, the project manager compares the current project to similar
past projects and uses that data to estimate the costs and resources required for the current
project.
The analogous model is also called expert or top-down estimation.
It is most reliable when the previous projects are similar in fact and not just in appearance.
With the parametric estimation model, the quantity of work that the team is to perform
is multiplied by the productivity rate of the team.
This model uses regression analysis and learning curve techniques.
For example, if 30 drawings are required, and the cost is $100 for each drawing, the
total cost would be $3,000.
In this example, the drawings are the quantity of work, and the productivity rate is $100.
The parametric model is also called a mathematical model.
Finally, with the bottom-up estimation model, the project manager estimates each work package 
individually
and then compiles the total project costs.
This model requires a Work Breakdown Structure (or WBS) to be effective.
The bottom-up model has a high level of accuracy in budget estimation.
Project managers should remember these nine considerations when planning and executing
a budget.
Enlist the support of Subject Matter Experts (or SMEs).
Their knowledge is critical to budget estimating success.
Ask a team member to validate estimates and act as a second pair of eyes to catch any
mistakes.
Track planned versus actual expenditures throughout the project to recognize variances early.
Proactively make course corrections and share project status with stakeholders.
Validate all assumptions.
Use information and technology to assist in overall project cost management.
The Project Management Institute (or PMI) refers to these systems as Project Management
Information Systems.
Use value-added decision-making models such as analogous, parametric, or bottom-up.
Review past lessons learned to avoid past budget and planning mistakes and leverage
opportunities previously discovered.
Understand funding limit reconciliation.
This PMI term means that funds allocated to your project must be used only on that project.
Any unused funds must be returned to the organization.
Understand project funding requirements, which is another PMI term.
Let the sponsor know when project funds are needed.
In most cases, the entire project budget will not be available on day one.
In this video, you learned that: A budget estimate approximates the time and
resources required to plan and complete a project.
There are two levels of budget estimates: Level 1 is Rough Order of Magnitude (or ROM)
And Level 2 is definitive estimate.
Estimation models assist project managers in determining project costs.
Three common models are: Analogous
Parametric And bottom-up
And there are nine considerations project managers should remember when planning and
executing a budget.

Use value-added decision-making models such as analogous, parametric, or bottom-up.
Review past lessons learned to avoid past budget and planning mistakes and leverage
opportunities previously discovered.
Understand funding limit reconciliation.
This PMI term means that funds allocated to your project must be used only on that project.
Any unused funds must be returned to the organization.
Understand project funding requirements, which is another PMI term.
Let the sponsor know when project funds are needed.
In most cases, the entire project budget will not be available on day one.
In this video, you learned that: A budget estimate approximates the time and
resources required to plan and complete a project.
There are two levels of budget estimates: Level 1 is Rough Order of Magnitude (or ROM)
And Level 2 is definitive estimate.
Estimation models assist project managers in determining project costs.
Three common models are: Analogous
Parametric And bottom-up
And there are nine considerations project managers should remember when planning and
executing a budget.


Project Planning
This article will teach you about project planning in detail and the steps to accomplish it. It will also 
cover the responsibilities of a business analyst and the development process managed by a business 
analyst. This article will also illustrate how the role of a business analyst and a project lifecycle 
intersect.
Introduction
A project manager organizes, plans, and executes projects while working within budget and 
timeline constraints. The key responsibility of the project manager is to ensure the project is 
completed on time and meets the desired quality standards. This is achieved by end-to-end planning 
specifications that a project manager is required to manage and oversee.
Project planning
Project planning is concerned with how to complete a project within a specific timeframe using the 
resources available. It entails developing a comprehensive project plan outlining the project's 
objectives, scope, timeline, budget, and deliverables. There is a process to plan a project 
successfully. It involves the following steps:
•	Developing a Project Charter
•	Project scope planning
•	Schedule and budget planning
•	Support planning
•	Sponsor's approval
Project planning process
Here is each step of project planning in detail.

The first step is to develop a Project Charter. A project charter is a document that formally 
authorizes the existence of a project. It provides an overview of the project's goals, objectives, 
scope, stakeholders, and key deliverables. It is created at the beginning of a project and must be 
completed and approved before project planning can begin. A requirement should not be planned if 
it is not documented in the Project Charter.
The second step is project scope planning. It defines the objective of the project and sets the project 
goals, roles, and responsibilities. Scope planning also facilitates the allocation of resources so that 
the project can be finished on time, within budget, and the stakeholder expectations.
After planning, the project's scope, schedule, and budget planning are accomplished. Schedule and 
budget planning are critical for keeping the project on track and within the fixed budget. It must be 
ensured that sufficient time and funds are available to complete the project's scope. If not, 
negotiation is done with the project sponsor to come up with a final settlement.
The fourth step is support planning. Support planning in a project involves identifying and planning 
for resources and activities that will be needed to support the project throughout its lifecycle. It 
includes the following important elements:
•	Resource planning
•	Communication planning
•	Risk management planning
•	Change management planning
•	Quality management planning
•	Procurements planning
Finally, the sponsor's approval is taken. The Sponsor's consent must be obtained at the end of the 
project planning process. Prior to starting a project, a meeting must be planned, and stakeholder 
approval must be obtained.
Role of a business analyst
Business analysts work closely with stakeholders to identify opportunities for improvement and to 
develop solutions that align with the organization's goals and objectives. They conduct research and 
analysis in order to come up with solutions to business problems and introduce systems to improve 
performance.
They work together with the project manager to successfully complete a project. The role of a 
business analyst involves focusing on the analysis and documentation of the requirement, while a 
project manager focuses on deliverables and timelines.
Development process
A business analyst oversees the following step-by-step development process:
•	Need Assessment,
•	Stakeholder Engagement,
•	Elicitation,
•	Analysis,
•	Traceability and Monitoring, and
•	Solution evaluation.
Need Assessment
Business analysts closely collaborate with the executive team of the organization to find potential 
project opportunities. They evaluate the present state, determine the required future state, and 
produce potential solutions. When solutions are accepted, they provide suggestions and create 
roadmaps for development.
Stakeholder Engagement
The second role performed by a business analyst is stakeholder engagement. This includes 
communicating with stakeholders to ensure that their needs are understood and that they are kept 
informed about the progress of the project from the beginning to the desired result.
Elicitation
Elicitation refers to the process of gathering and documenting the requirements of a project from 
stakeholders. Eliciting requirements is one of the business analyst's primary responsibilities. They 
choose the most effective elicitation strategy, make a game plan, carry out the elicitation, and verify 
the outcomes.
Analysis
The next role performed by a business analyst is analysis. This includes reviewing and analyzing 
current business processes to identify inefficiencies and areas for improvement. The business 
analyst makes use of a variety of analysis tools to identify and rank requirements, create models, 
and establish project acceptance standards.
Traceability and Monitoring
Traceability and monitoring include managing change related to implementing new processes or 
systems, including communicating the change to stakeholders and ensuring that the change is 
adopted effectively. For this, the business analyst develops a Traceability Matrix. It is defined as "A 
grid that links Product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them."
Solution evaluation
Solution evaluation involves assessing the potential impact and value of a proposed solution for a 
business problem or opportunity. The business analyst also aids in getting solutions approved for 
release.

Business analysis and project management link
Here is a quick overview of where and how the business analyst's duties relate to the project 
management lifecycle. As shown in the picture:
The project management Initiation Phase is followed by the Business Analysis activity.
The creation of the project charter is the last phase of the needs analysis.
Stakeholder analysis, elicitation, and engagement take place simultaneously with the needs 
assessment.
The Traceability Matrix is completed at the end of the Needs assessment and is used by the project 
manager to track development progress.
The business analyst participates in solution acceptance and testing and assists the project manager 
with project closeout, transition, and release.
Conclusion
Project planning is a crucial phase in project management that sets the foundation for the entire 
project. Effective project planning is critical for the success of any project. It helps to ensure that 
the project is well organized, that resources are allocated effectively, and that the project is 
completed within budget and on time. Business analysts play a critical role in project planning by 
helping to ensure that the project meets the needs of the business, stays on track, and delivers the 
intended outcomes.

Project Planning: Role of a Business Analyst 
Expanded
Product Roadmaps
The Business Analyst supports the development of Product Roadmaps. Product Roadmaps show 
high-level aspects of a product planned for delivery. The roadmap creates shared expectations on 
product deliverables and the order in which the client will receive them.
A well-defined roadmap contains multiple components shared with product owners and project 
managers.
•	It describes the product vision, how the product supports organizational objectives, required 
features, timelines, and a recommendation for the optimal project lifecycle that best supports 
product development.
•	This information is provided to product owners when the manager determines that an 
adaptive project lifecycle is best suited to product development. Or the manager may 
provide it to project managers if a predictive lifecycle is the best fit.
Tools and Techniques to Identify Requirements
A Business Analyst (BA) uses several tools and techniques to identify initial requirements that will 
lead to the development of project charters.
•	The BA conducts interviews, sends out surveys, facilitates workshops, and reviews lessons 
learned to determine potential problems the team can solve or opportunities to capture.
•	The BA develops user stories that determine what various organizational roles need and the 
value the product will deliver. They work closely with product owners and the development 
teams to define functionality and features that satisfy the customer's needs.
•	The BA may develop use cases to drive product development. A use case describes how a 
customer or user interacts with a system or product. A use case may establish the success 
scenarios, failure scenarios, product key performance indicators that the team must meet, 
and any critical variations or exceptions. These use cases help the product owner or project 
manager determine the requirements the team must achieve by the project end.
•	The BA may develop a product traceability matrix. This tabular overview of product 
development phases maps out precisely how a product will be designed and developed and 
which stakeholders must be involved during each phase to ensure success.
•	Finally, a Business Analyst can work closely with stakeholders to define acceptance criteria 
that will allow the project team to know if a product is ready for release and delivery.
The Business Analyst ensures that the product requirements meet the organization's needs. The 
product owner and project managers work to deliver the solution.
Conclusion
The Business Analyst plays a crucial role in supporting the development of Product Roadmaps, 
which outline the planned delivery of high-level product aspects. The Business Analyst also uses 
various tools and techniques such as interviews, surveys, workshops, user stories, use cases, and 
product traceability matrix to identify requirements and drive product development. The 
collaboration between the Business Analyst, product owner, and project managers leads to 
successful deliverables.

Scope Planning

Welcome to "Scope Planning."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize end-to-end scope planning, Explain requirements planning,
Describe the contents of a scope statement,
Describe the contents of a work breakdown structure (or WBS),
And explain the importance of a WBS dictionary.
The scope planning process includes identifying, outlining, and maintaining a project's scope.
It is arguably the most critical project planning you will perform.
The Project Management Institute (or PMI) states that a project manager needs to accomplish
the project on time, within budget, and within the required scope.
In the real world, however, if you don't deliver scope that adds value, being on time and within
budget won't matter much.
The PMI has a four-step scope planning approach.
It is a solid conceptual model that works in real working situations.
The four steps are:
Plan scope management,
Collect requirements,
Define scope,
And create a Work Breakdown Structure (or WBS).
The first step is to plan scope management.
The PMI recommends that the project manager develop and share a scope management plan.
This is not the final scope but is a simple plan that provides process and direction to
the team on how to define, develop, monitor, control, and validate scope.
This "how-to" plan describes how the project manager analyzes, documents, and manages 
requirements.
The next step in scope planning is requirements planning, which the PMI refers to as the collect
requirements process.
The project manager reviews the project charter and other applicable documentation.
Here are some important points to remember for the requirements planning process:
The project manager provides requirement documentation that defines the requirements in the 
project's
scope.
The goal of this phase is to summarize project charter requirements.
Strive for actionable and measurable requirements and define them in terms of action and result.
For example, "acquire a venue."
If the business analyst did not previously develop a project traceability matrix, the
manager or analyst develops it at this point.
The following scenario describes a simple project that shows an example of scope planning
documentation.
A manufacturing firm is planning an all-hands meeting, and you are the project manager.
These are key excerpts from the project charter for this scenario.
The event time and date have been set, and the venue is still to be determined.
The firm is to provide transportation for attendees, and catering will be provided.
The number of attendees and speakers has been determined, and the firm will provide technical
support for the event.
As the project manager, you would now determine the scenario collection requirements for this
project based on the information provided by the project charter.
This includes:
Acquiring the venue,
Planning transportation,
Planning catering,
Identifying speakers,
And planning audiovisual and technical support.
The next step in scope planning is defining the scope by developing a scope statement.
The PMI states that a scope statement is the most detailed version of the scope.
It clearly explains the project's aims.
The scope statement has four components.
Scope description or overview,
Deliverables,
Acceptance criteria, and
Exclusions.
Here is an example scope statement // describing the project scenario to plan and implement
an all-hands meeting in four ways.
This document:
Describes the project,
Lists all requirements or deliverables,
Identifies who can accept the final deliverables,
and lists exclusions.
Exclusions are a list of what the project will not provide.
The last step is to construct the work breakdown structure.
A WBS breaks down the scope statement into a hierarchical list of tasks necessary to
fulfill the project requirements.
The hierarchy plan runs from most general, starting with the whole project, through the
project phases, to the specific tasks, known as work packages.
A best practice is to break down the work packages using logical phasing.
The project manager should use the Plan Do Check Act (or PDCA) method.
And, all WBS work packages should be actionable, estimable, and measurable.
This is an example of a WBS using the project scenario.
The WBS is a hierarchical breakout of the project; a visual roadmap.
It looks like an organizational chart with the project in the top row,
then breaking down into Project Phase columns in the second row of boxes, followed by rows
of boxes with the activities required, or work packages, for each phase in the order
they occur below that.
The first project phase column in the second row represents planning the project.
The second column is the next phase, executing the project, and so on.
After the project manager constructs the WBS, it is essential to complete the WBS dictionary.
This document defines the tasks required to accomplish a WBS work package.
Some points to remember while completing the WBS dictionary are:
Each work package in the WBS is broken out into specific tasks.
The manager should assign a lead team member to each work package.
And the WBS dictionary becomes the primary source for the team to check the progress
status throughout the project.
This example WBS dictionary, based on our scenario, breaks out the specific tasks for
the first activity (or work package), Manage the Venue, listed under our 1st phase in the
WBS.
The Manage the Venue specific tasks are:
Research available venues
Select the appropriate venue, and
Sign the contract
In this video, you learned that:
The scope planning process is the manager's most critical project planning area.
The PMI has a four-step scope planning approach which includes:
Plan scope management,
Collect requirements,
Define scope,
And create a WBS.
A scope statement is the most detailed version of the project's scope.
A WBS breaks down the scope statement into a list of tasks.
And a WBS dictionary defines the tasks required to accomplish a WBS work package.


Schedule Planning

Welcome to "Schedule Planning."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain schedule planning and the steps involved,
Discuss types of dependencies,
And illustrate a project network diagram.
Schedule planning is the process of organizing and arranging tasks, events, and activities
in a structured manner to allocate time and resources effectively.
It involves setting priorities, determining available time slots, and using tools and
techniques to plan and monitor progress toward meeting goals and deadlines.
Schedule planning aims to improve efficiency and productivity by ensuring tasks are completed
promptly and in an organized manner.
The Project Management Institute (or PMI) has developed a five-step schedule planning
approach.
Create a schedule management plan,
Define activities,
Sequence activities,
Estimate activity durations, and
Develop a schedule.
The first step is to create a schedule management plan.
A project manager creates a schedule plan to specify the beginning and end dates of
a project, the key checkpoints along the route, and a deadline to finish each job individually.
The second step is to define activities.
The manager lists the tasks, activities, and events to include in the schedule. Each activity
must be defined to the point where time and cost durations can be reasonably estimated.
Avoid ambiguity.
Next, the project manager carefully considers each activity to determine which ones are
dependent on others to be completed.
All project dependencies must be defined so that the manager can appropriately schedule
the work and prevent delays.
After establishing dependencies among the activities, the manager can sequence them
to create an effective flow.
Project managers use the three-point method to determine how long each work package will
take. This method can be applied to both time and cost durations.
There are a few terms associated with this method. The first is "predecessor," which
defines an activity that happened first. Another term is "successor," which is the activity
that happened second.
In this illustration, Activity A is the predecessor to Activities B and C. Activities B and C
are the successors to Activity A.
Activities B and C depend upon the completion of Activity A. Activities B and C do not depend
on each other. The team can accomplish these activities simultaneously.
The PMI shares four distinct dependency determinations.
Mandatory dependencies are legally required or inherent; the team cannot ignore them.
These dependencies can impact the overall timeline and schedule of a project.
Examples of mandatory dependencies include:
Part sourcing before assembling,
And hardware installation before software installation.
An external dependency involves factors that are external to the project. These factors
are usually legal or regulatory by nature.
Examples of external dependencies include:
Approvals from external organizations or government agencies,
Availability of resources or equipment sourced from outside suppliers,
And compliance with regulations or laws.
Internal dependency refers to a situation where a task in a project depends on other
tasks in the project for completion. This creates a relationship between tasks and a
sequence for their completion.
Typically, the project manager and team have complete control over these dependencies.
An example of an internal dependency is the internal testing of product components before
the product is assembled.
The final type of determination is a discretionary dependency. Sometimes, there may be more than
one way to accomplish a task, and the project management team must decide which method to
follow.
The decision is based on their experience, best practices, and lessons learned.
An example of a discretionary dependency can be best explained with a scenario.
Activity A is booking an airline ticket, and activity B is buying travel insurance. The
project team can either book an airline ticket before buying travel insurance or do it the
other way around.
Returning to the five-step schedule planning approach, in the fourth step, the project
manager and the team members must estimate how long each activity or work package will
take to complete.
The best way to estimate the duration is to use data from similar past activities.
Finally, the project manager and the team members develop the final schedule.
The manager informs the sponsor and important stakeholders about this schedule for review
and approval. Once the sponsor and stakeholders approve the schedule, it becomes the project's
schedule baseline.
A network diagram is a useful tool that shows how all work packages need to be accomplished
and in what order. A work breakdown structure (or WBS) is required to build a network diagram.
The diagram shows the flow of activities, dependencies, and the critical path, which
helps in project planning, monitoring, and control.
The following scenario shows how a network diagram is built.
The nodes in the diagram represent tasks, while the arrows represent the dependencies
between them.
This project has five activities.
Activities A and B have no dependencies and can be accomplished simultaneously.
Activity C depends upon completing Activities A and B.
Activities D and E can also be accomplished simultaneously. They are both dependent upon
the completion of Activity C before work can begin.
The final step in building a network diagram is to add the durations to each activity,
as shown in the illustration. Durations are determined by days.
Activity A will take 5 days, Activity B will take 3 days, and so on.
Now that the network diagram is complete, the next task is to determine how many paths
are possible to complete the project. This example has four paths.
The critical path is the path with the longest duration. In this example, the longest path
is ACE. <speak A C E>
The critical path identifies the duration of the project. The duration of each activity
is summed up to calculate the critical path.
In this example, Activity A's duration is 5,
Activity C's is 8, and Activity E's is 7.
So 5 plus 8 plus 7 equals 20.
The critical path is 20 days.
The final step in schedule planning is ensuring that sponsors and important stakeholders are
informed about the network diagram and length.
The project manager obtains approval from the stakeholder and the sponsor, and the schedule
baseline is finalized.
In this video, you learned that:
Schedule planning is the process of organizing and arranging tasks, events, and activities
in a structured manner.
The PMI's 5-step planning approach includes:
Planning schedule management,
Defining activities,
Sequencing activities,
Estimating activity duration,
And developing a schedule.
The four types of dependency determinations are:
Mandatory,
External,
Internal,
And discretionary.
A network diagram is a useful tool for visualizing and analyzing a project schedule.
And the critical path is the path of the longest duration of a project.


Budget Planning Part 1

Welcome to a short project budgeting demo.
In this demo we will illustrate tools used in building and presenting a project budget
and share a common estimation methodology called three- point.
Let's begin with a two step approach to build a project budget.
Step number one is to begin with a review of the total cost for the project.
A simple Excel spreadsheet will often suffice.
Break out the costs by direct, indirect and reserve requirements.
A general rule is that contingency reserves are usually 10% times direct costs.
Management reserves are for unknown risks.
If you suspect there are many unknown risks, add additional contingency under the management
reserves.
Let's look at a simple example.
This is a project for the annual executive meeting support project.
We begin by defining our costs in this particular case, you'll notice we have them categorized
by venue, set up in venue, clean up, audio, visual, etc.
Next, we try to determine if they are direct or indirect costs.
As you notice in the notes, a direct cost is a cost that is charged to the project.
So, let's find our first example.
You'll notice that under direct cost set up and venue cleanup contractor supported.
This is a direct cost.
This means that the project manager needs to acquire $2,000, and the project will be
required to go ahead and disperse those funds to the contractor.
But we have another type of cost as well.
These are indirect costs, looking at our notes.
Indirect costs.
These are paid for by an external source.
If these costs were not paid by an external source, the project would need to plan an
account for them.
So, let's look at our example.
The first indirect cost we come to is $3,000.
What is this for?
Going across to the cost description.
This is for the venue, but you'll notice we have a note.
This is going to be paid for by the organization.
So, while the project is not paying for the venue, this is a cost to the project.
It's just being paid for by another third party.
In calculating the total costs of a project,
we add up all of the direct costs in this particular case, $6,000 and all of the indirect
costs.
In this case, $5,000, our total
project costs are $11,000.
One last piece of information.
We need to go ahead and calculate contingency reserves.
Contingency reserves are those extra dollars that are set aside in case risks occur.
Normally, contingency reserves are 10% times the direct costs.
So, if you look at this illustration, we have $600, we take 10%, we multiply it by 6000,
and we end up with 600.
This is dollars that we do not have access to unless we request them.
However, they are available in case a risk occurs.
Now let's take a look at step two.
Here, we determine when the funds are needed.
You need to phase your project funding requirements for a real-world project, allocating costs
to each work package or activity in the work breakdown structure, and using your network
diagram to determine when costs will be incurred, is a best practice.
Here's how that calculation could work.
But remember, only request direct costs.
Ensure what you are asking for
matches your direct cost requirements in step one.
And as a refresher, that was $6,000.
So, on this particular sheet, we take a look at our direct cost requirements, and now we
break them out into phases.
Phase one is planning.
Phase two is the day of the meeting, and phase three is the post-meeting.
These dates are February 15th for planning, February 20th for the day of the meeting,
and the post-meeting on February 24th.
Now we share the direct costs, and we annotate them when these dollars will be required.
So, we're going to require $2,500 on February 15th to support planning.
This will pay for setting up the venue and general supplies on the day of the meeting.
We need $2,500 in our account.
We're going to pay $1,000 to clean up the venue, $500 for beverages, $1,000 for catering,
and on February 24th, we will pay the final payment for the catering,
$1,000. Notice
2500,
2500, 1000 equals 6000.
This was our direct cost requirements.
This concludes Part 1 of our demo video.
We look forward to seeing you again in Part 2.


Welcome back! We hope you enjoyed Part 1 of our demo, welcome to part 2.
Now, you may choose to use a tool called a resource breakdown structure.
This is also generally an Excel spreadsheet, and it can help accomplish both steps one
and two on a single spreadsheet.
Let's use the executive meeting project to show how this could work.
Costs are captured under categories and work breakdown structure activity numbers match
the activity numbers to your schedule network diagram to determine when funds are required.
Again, only document direct funds.
So, let's take a look at this particular spreadsheet, the resource breakdown structure for the annual
Executive Meeting Support Project.
Each work breakdown structure-activity has its individual number.
The work package explains what is happening in each work breakdown structure-activity.
For example, activity 111 is to define the venue 112 is to determine in attendees.
Now what we need to do is we need to determine during which of these activities will our
total of $6,000 be required.
So, if you take a look, we have a $1,000 requirement for venue support.
If you recall from our previous step, this will occur during planning, and the funds
will be required on the 15th of February.
We have general supply requirement that will be required on the 15th of February as well.
Now, during the actual event, we need to pay for beverages, catering and in addition actual
meeting requirements in this case to support the catering.
These funds are required on the 20th of February and we're going to pay the outstanding catering
invoice on the 24th.
Again, take a look at the totals.
The total requirement is our direct cost of $6,000.
Now, one final area that we want to discuss regards estimation.
There is a methodology that is commonly used called three-point estimation.
Many project managers use single-point estimation.
They estimate time and cost by providing their best guess.
There are some costs that are set when this is the case.
Single-point estimation suffices in most cases, however, estimates may be impacted by a variety
of factors.
Three-point averaging requires the project manager and the team to analyze three estimates.
The most likely estimate is what the team believes will be the most likely costs.
The pessimistic estimate considers risk and the worst-case scenario.
The optimistic estimate considers opportunities that may reduce costs.
There are two ways to calculate three point.
Note that the three-point estimation is applicable to both cost and schedule estimates.
So, looking at three-point averaging,
we have a pessimistic amount of 45.
Most likely, it's going to cost us 25.
And if everything works out perfectly, we may escape with only spending 20.
Each one of the pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic numbers and estimates are multiplied
by one.
We multiply the pessimistic 45 times one equals 45.
Most likely, 25 times one equals 25.
Optimistic 20 times one equals 20, 45, 25 and 20 equals 90.
We divide this 90 by three, and the estimate that we're going to go ahead, and use is 30.
Now we have something called three-point estimation using PERT. PERT stands for program 
evaluation
review technique and this method is a little more complicated than the averaging method.
The PERT method weighs the optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates based on
statistical norms.
Studies have shown that the pessimistic and optimistic estimates will occur one out of
every six times.
The most likely estimate will occur four out of every six times.
This weighted criterion is based on the conclusion that estimation accuracy follows a statistical
standard distribution.
The most likely falls within one standard deviation of the mean, or approximately 67%
of the time.
The optimistic and pessimistic estimates fall within two or more standard deviations from
the mean or approximately 16% for both.
Hence the weights one, four, and one.
Use the PERT method in our example.
Let's go ahead and take a look.
We have our optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimates.
They have not changed.
However, the multipliers do.
We multiply the pessimistic by one, one times 45 for 45. Why?
Because the pessimistic is going to occur
one out of every six times we multiply the most likely estimate of 25 times four to equal
100. Why?
According to the standard distribution,
the most likely normally occurs four out of six times or 67%.
We multiply the optimistic 20 times one to equal 20. Why?
Because the optimistic is only going to occur
one out of every six times or approximately 16%.
We add up our totals 45, 120 to get to 165.
However, we're now going to divide 165 by six, when we take 165 and divide it by six,
now, the estimate that we're going to use is 27.5.
This concludes our overview of project budgeting as a quick summary.
Remember, we have two steps or we can combine the two steps with one step called the resource
breakdown structure.
And we learned an estimation technique called three-point. Thank you for your attention,
and we look forward to sharing more project management
best practices with you in demos to follow.
Have a great rest of your day.


Budget Planning
This article will teach you end-to-end budget planning.
Budget planning
Budget planning is the process of allocating and managing your income and expenses over a given 
period of time. It involves assessing your current financial situation, setting financial goals, and 
planning to achieve those goals.
PMI has defined a three-step budget planning approach.
•	Plan cost management,
•	Estimate costs
•	Determine budget
Plan cost management
The plan outlines how the team estimates, budgets, manages, oversees, and controls expenditures. 
This is also a "How to" plan process. PMI recommends developing and sharing this plan.
Estimate costs
An estimate cost involves estimating the costs of the resources required to complete the project. 
There are three types of costs: direct, indirect, and reserves.
•	Direct costs are expenses incurred directly in the process of producing a good or providing a 
service. These are paid out of the project budget. The project manager must calculate and 
request these funds from the sponsor. For example, labor costs, raw materials
•	Indirect costs are the overhead expenses that aren't directly connected to a product or 
service's manufacture or delivery. These expenses are difficult to link to a particular item, 
service, or undertaking. Indirect costs could be the cost of venues, utilities, full-time 
employee salaries, and often required training funded by the company.
•	Reserves are the percentage of the project budget set aside for unplanned or unanticipated 
expenditures throughout the project. There are two types of reserves: contingency and 
management reserves. Contingency Reserves are allocated to support known or identified 
risks, whereas management reserves are allocated to support unknown risks.
Determine costs
Determining cost is the process that involves aggregating and calculating the estimated costs of the 
project activities to establish a cost baseline. This baseline represents the authorized budget for the 
project and is used to monitor and control project costs. A solid budget documents direct costs, 
indirect costs, and reserves.
Conclusion
Budget planning is an essential financial tool that provides individuals and organizations with 
financial discipline, control, and flexibility to achieve their financial goals. The budget must reflect 
the individual or organization's financial situation accurately by considering all types of costs while 
planning.

Project Support Planning

Welcome to "Project support planning."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain project support planning, and Discuss key objectives of project support
planning.
Project support planning is identifying and managing the resources and support needed
to successfully execute a project.
This involves including personnel, equipment, technology, training and financial resources.
It begins after the scope, schedule, and cost baselines are approved and accepted.
The key objectives of support planning include: Quality management planning,
Resource Breakdown Structure, Communications management plan,
Risk planning, Procurement planning, and
Stakeholder engagement planning.
Quality management planning involves the development of a plan to ensure that the project 
deliverables meet the required quality standards.
A quality management plan documents the methods and guidelines applied in quality management.
This plan also describes Quality Assurance planning and Quality Control planning.
The Resource Breakdown Structure visually represents the project's resource requirements.
It divides those resources into smaller, easier-to-manage components.
Here is an example of an RBS that specifies the planning and managing of resources.
Create a column that lists people responsible for each Work Package.
You may also enlarge the RBS to include start and finish dates for every WBS work package.
A communications management plan outlines the communication requirements and expectations
for a project.
It is developed by the project manager during support planning and approved by the sponsor.
This plan identifies key communication items, Assigns team leads to each item,
Provides audience and media information, Outlines timing issues,
And tells the purpose of the communication.
Here is an illustration with a sample entry.
Risk planning is the process of identifying, evaluating, and managing risks to reduce their
influence on a project or organization.
It includes the following three elements: Plan Risk Management,
Identify Risks and Monitor Risk.
The first step is to develop a risk management plan that outlines shared methods, roles and
responsibilities, and risk-scoring standards.
The second step is to identify risks.
To accomplish this step, evaluate the project and record the risks.
This helps to create solutions to lessen threats and increase opportunities.
The last step is to monitor risks.
Perform periodic reassessment of risks to monitor them.
This will help to determine any new risks and implement risk responses whenever needed.
Procurement planning is the process of identifying and procuring the products and services required
to complete a project.
It is essential to ensure that organizations are able to acquire the goods and services
they need in a timely and cost-effective manner.
This process involves developing a procurement management plan which includes all information
and guidance necessary to manage the end-to-end procurement process.
The last plan is stakeholder engagement planning.
It involves identifying and evaluating the stakeholders engaged in a project or initiative
and successfully interacting with them throughout the project's life cycle.
Involvement of stakeholders is essential to success.
Therefore, the project manager and team assess each stakeholder's current and desired levels
of commitment and develop strategies to sustain or achieve desired levels of commitment.
In this video, you learned that: Project support planning is the identification
and management of the resources and support a project requires for successful execution.
And the key objectives of project support include:
Quality management planning, Resource Breakdown Structure,
Communications management plan, Risk planning,
Procurement planning, and Stakeholder engagement planning.


Project Procurement Management
Project Procurement Management includes processes necessary to purchase or acquire products, 
services, or results needed from outside the Project Team. This includes management and control 
processes to develop and administer agreements such as contracts, purchase orders, Memorandums 
of Agreement (MOA), or Service Level Agreements.
The project manager oversees the creation of a Procurement Management Plan. This plan drives all 
procurement activities required to support the project. The project manager also manages and 
controls the end-to-end procurement process and ensures all seller deliverables meet the needs of 
the buyer organization. The Project Manager is not required to be an expert in procurement 
management but must identify experts who are.
Procurement Management Plan Contents
The Procurement Management Plan should include the following:
•	How the team will integrate procurement into the project scope, schedule, and cost baselines
•	Procurement schedules
•	Procurement metrics or key performance indicators goals
•	Procurement roles and responsibilities
•	Any assumptions or constraints that may impact procurement
•	Legal considerations that affect the procurement
•	Determination of independent estimates to validate seller proposal feasibility is needed
•	Source selection criteria that the team will use to select sellers
•	Risk factors that affect procurement
•	Prequalified Sellers-those sellers authorized to submit proposals
Types of Contracts
The project manager must determine the type of contract that will support the procurement. There 
are three common contract types to consider:
•	A Fixed Price contract enables the seller to provide a bid to provide services. The costs are 
known up-front, which reduces risk to the buyer.
•	With a Cost Reimbursement contract, the seller describes what they need. The costs are 
unknown up-front; the team receives invoices throughout the project. This contract type 
places risk on the buyer.
•	The manager usually uses a Time and Material contract for quick and easy procurements. 
The benefit of this type of contract is a fast procurement cycle with minimal negotiations 
needed.
The Procurement Management Plan becomes part of the finalized Project Management Plan 
approved by a Sponsor and accepted by stakeholders.
Conclusion
Project Procurement Management involves acquiring projects, services, or results from external 
sources through contracts and purchase orders. The Project Manager creates a Procurement 
Management Plan, which guides procurement activities and identifies experts. The manager uses 
different contract types, such as Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, and Time and Material.

Welcome to a brief demonstration on Earned Value Management or EVM as it's referred
to Earned Value Management. As you can see on this illustration, is defined as a method used
to determine the scope, budget and schedule of a given project in a given point in time.
EVM is an area of concentration on the Project Management Institute's Project Management
Professional. PMP and Certified Associate of Project Management CAPM Certification
Examinations. It is also a focus area on a number of additional PMI certification tests as well.
In this demo, we will define four key measurements that are required to calculate EVM. They are
abbreviated as BAC, PV, EV, and AC. We will then share an analysis of a sample project. We will
finish the demo by walking you through seven key calculations that can help us understand
the status of a project. So, let's begin by defining the key measurements and providing
status for this particular project. The first key measurement is called Budget At Completion. It is
abbreviated as BAC the budget at completion is the total approved project budget. If you look at
this example, we have for our sample project a budget at completion of $100,000. This is how
much money you, as the project team, have been provided to execute this particular project.
Planned value is abbreviated as PV. The definition of planned value is the dollar
value of deliverables you had planned to have complete at this time in the project.
So, looking at our sample project, we have a planned value or PV of $50,000. We had planned
to have $50,000 worth of deliverables complete at this particular time.
EV is defined as earned value. This is the dollar value of deliverables you have completed at this
time in the project. So, if you look at our sample project, we have an earned value of
55,000. That means that we have successfully completed $55,000 worth of deliverables.
Last is AC or actual cost. Definition: The actual cost incurred to support the project to date. So,
in this particular case and our sample project, we have $60,000. So, now let's do a quick
evaluation of BAC, PV, EV, and AC. For this sample project, we initially have a budget of $100,000
at this particular point. We should have $50,000 worth of our deliverables produced.
We actually have $55,000 worth of the deliverables produced. However,
we have spent $60,000 of our $100,000 budget to date. So, what can we do with this BAC,
PV, EV, and AC information? We can next apply some EVM calculations.










Demo: Planning Earned Value Management 
Part 2


Welcome back ! We hope you
enjoyed part 1 of our demo , welcome to part 2.
The first calculation we're going to take a look at is cost variance. The acronym
for cost variance is CV. We have a formula. It is earned value versus actual cost. So,
looking at our scenario, our earned value is 55,000. Our actual costs are 60,000.
When we subtract 60,000 from 55,000. We end up with a -$5,000. So, what is our
interpretation of -$5,000? It tells us that this is negative. We are behind on budget by $5,000.
We have $55,000 worth of product. However, we spent 60,000 to get that 55,000. We are $5,000
behind. This project is behind on budget. The next calculation is schedule variance. The acronym is
S.V. The formula for SV is earned value EV minus planned value. PV. So, let's apply the numbers.
Our earned value once again is 55,000. Our planned value is 50,000. Subtracting 50,000 from 
55,000,
we now have a positive number of 5000. Well, what does this mean? This is a positive number,
and we are ahead of schedule. So, let's go ahead and take a look at this a little bit more in
detail. Earned value. We have $55,000 worth of product, and we had only planned to have
$50,000. Our PV of product at this time were $5,000 in terms of product production ahead.
We are ahead of schedule. So going back to our calculations, you'll notice the acronyms C,
V and N, SV. Whenever you have a C, that is an indicator for a budget status.
Whenever you have S, it is an indicator for a schedule status. Now let's take a look at our
third calculation cost performance index, that is abbreviated as CPI.
Our formula is earned value, this time divided by actual cost. So, our earned value is 55,000.
We divide this by 60,000 and round to the nearest hundredths when performing earned value 
management
calculations. The answer is 0.92. What does this mean? Well, this means that in this particular
case, we have an earned value of 55,000, but we spent 60,000 to go ahead and achieve that
55,000 worth of value. In essence, we're getting $0.92 of value for every dollar
that we are spending when it comes to CPI, and remember, the letter C tells us this is about
budget. If the number is less than 1.0, it means we are behind on budget. We are
only getting value of $0.92 for every dollar that we spend. Not terrible, but not good.
Let's move to our fourth calculation, SPI schedule performance index. Again, letter S,
this is going to give us status on our schedule. The formula is earned value, EV divided by PV. So,
we go back to our numbers. EV is 55,000, and PV is 50,000. Well, in this case, we end up with a
number greater than 1, 1.1. What does this tell us? It means that we are ahead of schedule. When
a number is greater than 1.0, this is good. We are ahead of schedule. If it is behind, we are behind
schedule. So, let's take a look at this a little bit deeper. EV, 55,000, we have $55,000 worth of
product, and we only thought we were going to have $50,000 worth of product. We are moving at a 
110%
rate as compared to the 100% rate. If PV equaled a EV ahead of schedule, now we go down to a C,
which is estimate at completion. We have to refer back to our budget at completion, 100,000, and 
we
also have to refer back to a previous calculation, the CPI. We calculated the CPI at 0.92.
So, by taking our 100,000 and dividing it by 0.92, we end up with a number of 108,696. What does 
this
mean? What it means is if we make no adjustments and the current trend continues through the end
of the project, if the project cost and the current trend is unchanged, this project will
cost us $108,696. That is for our variance at completion, $8,696 more than we had planned
to spend. We are in the red, so, unless we do something, we are going to spend $8,696 more
than the $100,000 we were allocated in our budget at completion. So, as a synopsis, as a summary,
this project is over budget. However, it is ahead of schedule. That's the good news. The team must
try to reduce costs through the remainder of this project so that you can get back on budget.
This concludes our demonstration Earned Value Management is a technique that is
being used as a project status tool by many organizations. We hope you enjoyed this demo,
and we look forward to sharing key project management principles and tools,
and techniques with you again. Have a great rest of your day.



Planning Earned Value Management
This article will teach you the concept of Earned Value Management. It will also cover key data 
points used to calculate real-time EVM.
Earned Value Management (EVM) 
Earned Value Management (EVM) is continuous, real-time monitoring of project progress, 
considering costs and schedule constraints. Comparing scope, schedule, and cost provides a status 
that can be shared or used to direct the course of action throughout the project. 
Here is a list of key data points to understand EVM.
Budget at Completion (BAC) 
Budget at Completion (BAC) is the total budget allotted to the project to cover all direct 
expenditures. For example, the allocated budget to complete the project is $100,000.
Planned Value
Planned Value (PV) represents the cost budgeted for a specific task or activity in the project plan up 
to a certain time, which provides a baseline for assessing project performance and progress. 
For example, if your BAC was $100,000 and you are halfway through the project, you will plan to 
spend $50,000 of the allotted budget now.
Actual Costs (AC) 
Actual Costs (AC) are the amount the project has spent. For example, if PV was $50,000, and you 
have spent $60,000, then you are $10,000 over budget.
Earned Value (EV) 
Earned Value (EV) represents the value of the work completed up to a certain point in time based on 
the project plan. To calculate the EV, multiply the planned percentage of completion by the 
budgeted cost for the specific task. 
For example, Assuming a task is 50% complete up to a certain date and its total budgeted cost is 
$10,000, then its EV up to that point is $5,000 (50% x $10,000).
Conclusion
Project managers can use these information points to determine the performance of a project and 
make informed decisions that will help to keep the project on budget.

Gaining Project Approval and Acceptance
This article will teach you about the project management plan (PMP) approval process, project 
kickoff meeting, and how to make an effective presentation.
A project management plan (PMP)
A project management plan (PMP) is a document that a project manager creates to clearly define the 
project's goals, the processes the team will implement, and how the manager will monitor and 
control the processes to accomplish the project goals. This plan is essential for project success. 
Without a PMP, you cannot expect a project to be delivered timely and successfully. Developing 
this plan requires a lot of work, analysis, and collaboration.
The PMP approval process
Here are the steps involved in the PMP approval process.
First, the project manager must gain sponsor approval for the project. The project manager presents 
a baseline presentation to the sponsor to achieve this goal. After sponsor approval, the project 
manager schedules a kickoff meeting to present the complete plan to stakeholders. After the 
stakeholders accept the plan, the plan becomes the project's baseline.
Reviewing the kickoff meeting
A kickoff meeting should be brief. The information you provide to stakeholders should have been 
presented, discussed, and negotiated at the planning stage.
According to the Project Management Institute (PMI), presentations can be formal or informal. 
Formal presentations, such as a kickoff, are recorded and shared with a wide audience. Informal 
presentations do not need to be shared. Note that the conversations made before the formal meeting 
to gain consensus are informal.
Making effective presentations
Five important factors determine the effectiveness or success of a presentation. These include:
•	Being prepared
•	Being organized
•	Using the expertise of a Subject Matter Expert (SME)
•	Documentation
•	Meetings before the meeting.
Being prepared
The most important factor in determining presentation success is "be prepared." Never present if 
you do not understand the presentation material. As a project manager, the project sponsor expects 
you to be an expert in understanding and managing the project. You should anticipate potential 
questions and be ready to respond satisfactorily.
Being organized
Another important factor related to a successful presentation is "be organized." Develop an agenda 
for the kickoff meeting and stay within it. The agenda should:
•	Introduce and overview the project and the project team,
•	Share key project details such as the scope, schedules, costs, and risks, and
•	End with a formal recommendation for approval, cancellation, postponement, etc.
Using the expertise of a Subject Matter Expert (SME)
Being a project manager, you should try to learn as much about the project as possible. That said, 
you might not be able to answer all the questions that participants ask during the kickoff meeting. 
Therefore, ensure an SME is available and ready to answer these questions.
Documentation
Documentation is another crucial factor that a project manager must consider making an effective 
presentation. You must document every step you've taken before the kickoff meeting. This includes 
the approval from the sponsor and the acceptance obtained from the stakeholders. You should share 
this documentation with the stakeholders during the kickoff meeting.
Meetings before the meeting
The last important factor a project manager should consider for a successful presentation is "having 
meetings before the kickoff meeting."
The information shared in the baseline presentation and during the kickoff meeting should not 
surprise the stakeholders. Before the kickoff meeting, collaboratively, all the necessary negotiations 
must be made, and the project manager should define the scope, schedule, and budget. Collaborate 
with the sponsor and the key stakeholders at every stage of the planning process. The best approval 
and acceptance meetings are approved.
Conclusion
Developing a PMP is crucial for the success of any project. It helps to clearly define the project 
goals, processes, and how the project manager will monitor and control the processes to achieve the 
desired outcomes. The project manager must be prepared and organized, use the expertise of an 
SME, document every step taken, and collaborate with the project sponsor and key stakeholders at 
every stage of the planning process to ensure a successful presentation. By following these steps 
and considering these factors, project managers can increase the chances of project success.

Expert Viewpoints: Project Support Planning

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Project Support Planning.
In this video, we will hear from project managers on project planning.
There's three things that immediately come to mind that can impact the effectiveness
of project planning.
First, is racing through it and not spending enough time, planning and researching and
understanding what it is that you as the project manager need to do in order to make the project
successful.
If you don't dedicate enough time early on and you decide that you want to build the
plane as you go, it's only going to lead towards much more risk and much more change 
management
than what you want to manage, and the negative impact that that can have can be quite devastating
on the project from a quality standpoint.
From a timeline perspective and from a budgetary perspective. You may think that you're saving
time by racing through project planning, but in the end it might end up taking more
time than ever.
Second, the second thing that is key to project planning is having the right resources involved.
Your project team when you're planning may be different than the project team when you're
executing, there may be just a few folks who will go over into the escalation, or they
may just be a few people who roll over into the execution
phase of your project.
But assuring that you've got the right resources in planning will help you with that transition
and also make sure that the project is staffed correctly from the beginning.
And then third is clear understanding of the scope.
Part of project
planning is doing the work breakdown schedule and setting
up the timeline.
And if you don't have a clear project scope, then neither of those activities will be successful
and your project
team will not have a clear vision of what it is
that
they need to get done.
So the three most important things for project planning is one, allow sufficient time and don't
race through it; two, ensure
that you have
the proper resources that you need to both plan and execute the project; and then three,
to make sure
that you have a
very clear understanding of the goals and the
scope of work that needs to be done.
Impacts of effective project planning can include a change in the scope or stakeholders,
the amount of time estimated becomes unfeasible and needs to make changes.
A lack of team building and communication can really impact
your overall project.
Well, let me be honest with you.
We could probably spend the next hour or two discussing this question, because there are
plenty of things that can impact the effectiveness of your planning.
But let me begin with one of my favorite quotes from Benjamin Franklin.
"If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail."
So here are my top four reasons or impacts, if you will. Number one,
failure to gain approval of a project charter even beyond that, failure to even develop a
project charter in the first place.
Remember that the project charter is the basis for all planning.
It lists the project goals and high-level objectives.
Planning accomplished without the benefit of a project charter will likely lead to
scope creep and project failure
in the end. A little bit more on that point later.
Secondly, another quote, "Know what you know, know what you don't know, and surround yourself
with people who know what you don't know."
Ensure you have the subject matter experts available to help you effectively plan, otherwise,
your plan will likely be flawed.
Failure to have the meeting before the meeting.
Share your scope, schedule and budget with key stakeholders as they are developed.
Do not wait until everything is completed.
Effective project planning addresses scope first.
Once the scope baseline is approved,
schedule and budget planning is completed and approved as well.
Finally, support planning is completed.
Be inclusive and get sign off each step along the way.
Finally, assumptions, definition: assumptions are factors we believe to be true but have
not validated.
Remember this:
assumptions lead to risks,
risks lead to issues, issues lead to problems and potential project failure.
Don't assume; validate your assumptions.

Expert Viewpoints: Project Support Planning 
Tips

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Project Support Planning Tips.
In this video, we will hear tips and advice from project managers on how to ensure successful
project support planning and which aspect of planning is most critical for project success.
First off, have a successful internal hand over.
Get to know the actual project.
The Project Charter that's presented, whether you are presenting it or someone else presented
it to you.
And then from there, a project kick off that's well thought out, well planned, and worked
with others.
And then from there, do not skip planning at all.
You have to have a great planning strategy in order to move forward.
If you rush into something, it will not be done the right way.
It's just like a train that has half of a rail.
It's not going anywhere.
Find a good template for project planning that you like to use.
Make changes where you need to and get feedback on it from your project
managing coach or mentor.
Reuse it for projects that are
similar and tweak it as you go.
Ask yourself what if questions?
What if we shorten one phase in order to lengthen another phase?
What if we add
a resource so we can shorten the phase? Or what if we take away a resource?
These types of what if scenarios if you just
jot them down
can help you identify areas where there may be risk, and it may also help you identify
areas where change
management comes into play.
So play around with your what if scenarios.
They're often also good conversation starters with your mentors or with other team project
team members that you find inspirational.
Document your communication plan and your escalation plan.
It's never too early to start on communication plan and you should always have
an escalation plan as part of your overall project plan.
Even if you hope that you don't need.
To use your escalation plan, have it in
place so that you're not floundering
around when an escalation does happen.
Work on your work back schedule and your work breakdown schedule.
Understand the scope of the work that needs to be done and work with your team members
so
that they understand it too.
Start that early on in the project planning and when you get
to execution, it will
run
more smooth.
Well, first and foremost,
communicate effectively.
Communication is the glue that holds the project together.
Ensure all key stakeholders are aware of the current status and are proactively aware and
working any issues.
Next, understand the project and the skill sets and personnel essential to success.
List these required personnel resources in the project Charter and gain approval to include
these essential subject matter experts in planning.
Third a point worth repeating the objectives in the project Charter are the guidelines
to effectively plan the project.
If the requirement is in the project charter plan for its accomplishment.
If the requirement is not in the project Charter.
As we mentioned earlier,
planning this requirement will result in scope creep.
All aspects of support planning are incredibly critical.
The one that I think always bubbles up to the top is communication.
Without clear communication, that's consistent, that's accurate, that's proactive,
everything else is part that's part of the project is
going to fall
apart. You won't be able to manage your stakeholders
well, your leadership of the project is going to run into bumps,
and as a whole, the project team just is not going to work well together. So the most important
part to support planning is having a very clear communication plan, one that you can tailor
towards the communication desires of your team, whether it's your internal team, your
management team, your leadership team or your
client team. It's incredibly important to build the rapport
with the client
through communication in the way
that they want.
Do they want emails?
Do they want chat messages?
Are they willing to use their cell phone and text message?
Having a happy client getting the information they
need and having
it at their fingertips
will make the project go a lot better.
To be successful in support planning,
you have to really understand the full scope of the
project in order to move forward.
From there, you need to identify if you need additional training, whether it's for individuals
or those that are going to be joining later on, whether it's external to your customer
or just internal for the support team.
This is a trick question.
The answer is all aspects of support planning are critical.
Let's begin by reviewing a brief list of some of the support planning that is required to
support a project
after,
keyword after,
scope, schedule, and budget have been approved and signed off.
Number one, quality.
Quality assurance and quality control are essential to ensure the project conforms to
requirements and provides a fit for use product or service.
A project with no quality assurance or quality control is probably a project that is destined
to fail.
Secondly, communications planning is essential to ensure the right information gets to the
right people at the right time and in the right amount.
Please consider developing a communications management plan and following it.
Third, you can manage risk or risk will manage you.
Ensure all risks are identified and responses are developed.
Include all stakeholders in effective project risk management.
Next resources include personnel, equipment, supplies and materials.
Ensure you identify the resources you require when they are required and gain approval from
functional managers who control these resources.
Key roles and responsibilities in a project is the functional manager, the individual
or group that controls or manages the resources that you need.
Finally, plan for any third-party support that is needed.
Develop a procurement management plan.
There are sometimes when you are required to outsource supplies, certain materials,
certain services that cannot be provided internally and as the project manager you need to manage
and control this process.
This concludes this set of questions on project planning.
Thank you very much and I hope to see you again in future SME interviews.
Have a great rest of your day.

Module 5 Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:
•	The end-to-end planning process and all project managers should follow this process to 
improve the potential for success. You also learned about the role of the business analyst 
(BA). The role of the BA and the BA framework is a key area of emphasis on the CAPM 
test.
•	The distinct processes provide a roadmap to follow when planning scope, schedules, and 
costs. All planning should be approved and accepted to finalize the scope, schedule, and cost 
baselines. Remember to plan the scope first. The scope should meet the entire needs of the 
project as defined in the project charter.
•	Support planning begins after the manager finalizesthe scope, schedule, and cost baselines. 
Support planning ensures that the team addresses and plans for project quality, resources, 
communications, risk, and procurements accordingly.
•	Earned Value Management (EVM) is used in many organizations and is a great way to show 
the project's progress. EVM analysis also allows project managers to make directional 
changes as needed to get a project back on track when it falls behind on schedule, budget, 
and production of deliverables. EVM is an area of concentration on the CAPM test.
•	The project manager is responsible for gaining project management plan approval and 
acceptance. 

Key Takeaways


A solid foundation in project management initiation and planning can help you unlock the potential 
of successful project execution. This course guided you in learning about project initiation and 
planning processes.
The key takeaways from this course include:
•	Projects may use a predictive or adaptive method. Predictive, or Waterfall, projects are a 
traditional approach that relies on planning and a predetermined project scope. Adaptive, or 
Agile, projects are a flexible, iterative approach that embraces change and focuses on 
adaptability.
•	The Project Management Institute (PMI) developed the most common project phasing 
method, which includes initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and 
closing.Project managers can improve the potential for project success by following this 
end-to-end planning process.
•	Organizations can impact a project manager's ability to be successful. The primary impact is 
on authority, role, availability of resources, availability of staff, and control of the budget.
•	The Project Management Office (PMO) is an organization's centralized department or team 
responsible for establishing and maintaining project management standards, practices, and 
methodologies. The three types of PMOs are supportive, controlling, and directive.
•	The twelve key principles listed in the Project Management Body of Knowledge 7th edition 
(PMBOK7)are:
•	Being a diligent, respectful steward
•	Creating a collaborative project team environment
•	Engaging with stakeholders
•	Focusing on value
•	Recognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions
•	Demonstrating leadership behaviors
•	Tailoring based on the context
•	Building quality into processes and deliverables
•	Navigating complexity
•	Optimizing risk responses
•	Embracing adaptability and resiliency
•	Enabling change to achieve the envisioned future state
•	Project management is an art and a science, and you should practice your interpersonal skills 
to be an effective project manager and avoid project failure.
•	The virtual environment is a reality in today's modern project management world. Project 
managers should expect virtual challenges and be ready to plan around them.
•	Organizing and leading effective meetings is a critical project management skill. Meetings 
are a core means of project communications.
•	A project manager must motivate the team and stakeholders to commit to performing the 
project's activities.
•	The PMI's common models for influencing stakeholders include Theories X, Y, and Z, The 
7-step Team Performance Model, and the Influence Diagram.
•	Change is inevitable, and it's important to remember you can manage change, or it can 
manage you. If change is required, approach change management in a structured and 
proactive manner. 
•	The PMI project management quality process includes quality assurance (QA) and quality 
control (QC).
•	A business case, a project charter, and project briefs are important documents that project 
managers must often create or execute. 
•	A business case outlines the justification for undertaking the project initiative. It provides a 
detailed analysis of the project's potential benefits, costs, risks, and feasibility.
•	A project charter is a formal document that authorizes the existence of a project and provides 
a high-level overview of the project, outlining its objectives, scope, stakeholders, and key 
deliverables.
•	A project brief is a concise document that provides an overview of a project. It outlines the 
essential details and requirements of the project, serving as a communication tool between 
stakeholders, project managers, and team members.
•	A stakeholder register defines the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders essential for 
project success.
•	Decision-making is a critical skill essential to a project manager's success. Some decision-
making techniques project managers use are voting, fist-to-five, nominal group technique 
(NGT), autocratic, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and Wideband Delphi.
•	Do not assume stakeholder commitment; instead, use the stakeholder engagement plan to 
develop strategies to keep stakeholder commitment high.
•	Project managers must understand financial metrics as many projects are approved to 
improve monetary returns. Financial analysis is a critical project selection process, and 
project managers must plan budgets correctly to support scope and schedule requirements.
•	The project scope should be planned first and meet the project's needs as defined in the 
project charter.
•	Support planning begins after the project manager finalizes the scope, schedule, and cost 
baselines. Support planning ensures that the team addresses and plans for project quality, 
resources, communications, risk, and procurements.
•	Earned Value Management (EVM) is used in many organizations and is a great way to show 
the project's progress. EVM analysis allows project managers to make directional changes to 
get a project back on track when it falls behind. 
•	The project manager is responsible for gaining project management plan approval and 
acceptance. 


Module 2  Project Lifecycle, Information 
Sharing, and Risk Management

Welcome to the Project Lifecycle, Information Sharing, and Risk Management course.
This course is ideal for beginners or professionals with business experience who want to sharpen
their business skills or even transition into a project management role.
This course provides information and best practices in three key areas of project management,
including importance of lifecycles,
effective information sharing, and risk management.
Concepts related to these areas are presented in five modules.
The last module will provide you with an opportunity to apply your newly acquired skills in a 
graded project.
Module 1 introduces different project lifecycles.
Lifecycles provide a roadmap for project managers to follow.
A project lifecycle provides a step-by-step approach to planning, executing, and implementing
the project in a proven way.
The proper use of the project lifecycle can aid a project manager in preventing project
failure.
It is said that "communication is the glue that holds the project together."
Module 2 provides insights into why effective communication is important in project management.
The module also introduces different communication styles and provides tips for effective 
communication.
The Project Management Institute (or PMI) states that the greatest challenge faced by
project managers is maintaining stakeholder commitment and motivation to support the project.
Module 3 provides an understanding of stakeholder management.
The module also introduces tools that a project manager can use to identify stakeholders and
gain their commitment and support.
You will also be introduced to the team charter, an essential aspect of stakeholder management.
Module 4 gets you started with project risk management.
This module introduces you to the basic terminology, such as risk, threat, opportunity, and issue.
The module also initiates you into some key concepts in risk management.
Module 5 delves into the response strategies that can be used to manage risks.
You will also be introduced to tools and methods, such as risk audits and risk reassessment.
Finally, in module 6, you with have the opportunity to apply the concepts you learned in the course
into a project.
You will submit your work and grade your peers.
This is followed by a final assessment quiz.
This course will be an aid if you plan to attain any PMI certifications, including:
Certified Associate in Project Management (PMI-CAPM),
Project Management Professional (PMI-PMP), or
Project Risk Management Certification (PMI-RMP).
Review the opportunity to qualify and attain these certifications at pmi.org.

Lifecycle Overview

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Lifecycle Selection Management.

In this video, we will hear from Project Managers discussing common Project lifecycles they
use in their organization, and how they'd use the lifecycles in a project
Based on my experience, I just really want to share three of them.
One of them is the traditional Waterfall Model.
This is wonderful for events, straightforward projects.
You simply plan, once you have your plan, you implement the plan.
You do it; you check to make sure that the plan is working, and you follow up.
And you deliver the product or the service, or you go back and fix it.
I do an awful lot of process development and process improvement work as well, and another
common lifecycle that I like to use is what we call
the DMAIC model.
DMAIC stands for define, measure, analyze, implement, and control.
If you ever study for Six Sigma, if you're looking to become a green belt, or perhaps
even a black belt, you will be asked to go ahead and implement a Six Sigma project, a
process development or process improvement project, and you will get an opportunity to
use that DMAIC model.
The last model that I want to go ahead and share is an agile model, but in particular
- Scrum.
I enjoy using Scrum when we need some kind of an iterative process when the customer
is looking for quick deliveries, and when we anticipate an awful lot of change.
A common life cycle that we use in our organization includes initiating, planning, executing,
monitoring, and controlling, and closing.
In practice, in my organization, I work closely with our Google Partnership.
, We initiate our project with Google, but this can apply to any project by really discovering
the scope of what needs to be accomplished through the project.
So if they want to make refresh a certificate, for example, let me have a conversation with
Google to understand well which components are we refreshing.
What is our timeline?
What's our budget?
And from there, we move on to selecting a vendor, and when we talk to the vendor, we
let them know the scope of the project then and give them more granular details of what
needs to be accomplished, and then come back to us with their proposed timeline as well
as their proposed deliverables based on what Google needs, which then moves us over to
planning.
Planning is very collaborative.
In my particular instance, involves Google and vendors, and that's where we really get
through finalizing the timeline, finalizing the smaller, the more granular chunks of a
specific timeline when we want to have specific deliverables like videos assessments, readings,
etc.
And then when we also want to time a lot time for QA and review.
Then that moves us over to executing, and in the execution phase, that's when we really
get into putting our heads down and doing the work.
And that brings us over to monitoring and controlling.
I think there are different ways to handle monitoring and controlling.
I personally like to have weekly check-ins and then also disperse larger check-ins between
the vendor and Google, and myself, where we really delved into the details of the project.
However, I do have colleagues that do something more like daily stand-ups, which I have done
in the past as well, and then something more like biweekly meetings.
I think it really just depends on the cadence of your or your desired cadence as well as
how everyone works together, and then finally, that brings us over to closing of the project,
assuming everything goes well, and you always hope that it does you close right on time
and if it does not, then you will figure out where you have room to extend your deadline.
And at closing, I think it's always fun to celebrate the projects, celebrate milestones
and then also do a recap of what went well and what did not go well.
There's a gentleman named Ralph Stacey who came up with a wonderful model that is a best
practice in project selection today.
Stacey said that, take a look at two key aspects of a project.
One of them is technical complexity and the other is the level of agreement.
And by agreement, I mean agreement among the stakeholders in terms of what does
success look like at the end of the day?
When the technology is extremely complex, and there
is minimal agreement, which means the majority of the
stakeholders really have no clue what they want in the end, then agile is probably the
best way to go.
However, if the technology is relatively straightforward, you don't anticipate a lot of problems, and
there is general agreement among the stakeholders that regardless of how long this particular
project takes, at the end of the day, this is what we want, then probably Waterfall is
your best bet.

Adaptive Lifecycles

Welcome to "Adaptive Lifecycles."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify artifacts used in adaptive projects,
Define the purpose and make-up of a user story and a product backlog,
And explain the adaptive flow through plan, execution, and closure.
Artifacts are templates, documents, outputs, or deliverables.
In adaptive projects, there are three common artifacts to remember and be aware of:
Product backlog,
Sprint backlog,
And product increments.

The product backlog is a list or repository for all project requirements which the product
owner develops and maintains.
In adaptive project management, the product owner defines and documents requirements as
a user story.
The product owner then adds and prioritizes user stories to the backlog and works with
the team to determine which user stories the team will accomplish in a single iteration
or sprint.
A product launch may have a few or many user stories.
In addition, a product backlog may include user stories for single or multiple product
launches.
A minimal viable product (or MVP) is an increment the team produces in a single sprint.

Next, the agile team develops the sprint backlog.
The team selects a set number of user stories for implementation in each sprint.
The sprint backlog breaks each user story into tasks the team must accomplish.
The project owner lists tasks in the order in which they occur and assigns them to individual
team members.
The team uses the sprint backlog to stay on track and reduce the potential for scope creep.
In a traditional predictive project, the sprint backlog has the same characteristics as a
work breakdown structure (or WBS).
Product increments are deliverables from each iteration the team produces and delivers to
the customer for feedback through a product demo or review.
Every sprint should provide value as an increment.
However, this increment does not necessarily represent the final product.
During an agile project, the team builds a product one part at a time.
The final product will typically require multiple sprints before launching the finished product.
There are two parts to a user story.

Part 1 of the user story is the requirement description the product owner completes with
the customer.
The user story requirement contains three statements:

The role, or who needs this requirement,

The need, or what the specific need of the customer is,

And the business value of satisfying the need.

Part 2 of the user story is the acceptance criteria.
The product owner collaborates with the agile team and determines solutions to satisfy the
user story.
The product owner shares solutions with the customer, gains sign-off, then includes the
user story in the backlog.
Product owners should follow the DEEP model when creating a product backlog.
Detail: The product owner should ensure they include enough detail in each user story to
allow the team to build the solution successfully.
Estimate: Each user story requirement and solution definition must be specific and measurable
to the point where a team can determine the time and cost required.
Emerge: The product backlog will change after each sprint.
Customers may wish to add or modify requirements due to feedback the team receives at the demo.
Prioritize: Product owners should prioritize all user stories for the team to accomplish
them.
Product owners prioritize user stories on value and the logical order of product completion.

The agile product management overview process consists of nine steps.
Step 1: The product owner meets with customers to determine their product requirements and
discuss schedules and budget considerations.
Step 2: The product owner develops user stories to satisfy all product requirements with the
customer.
Step 3: The product owner meets with the team, who reviews each user story and proposes the
acceptance criteria to develop an increment or MVP.
Step 4: The product owner shares the user story acceptance criteria with the customer,
which validates the user story.
Step 5: The product owner places all user stories in the product backlog and prioritizes
them in the order in which they occur.
Step 6: The team meets with the product owner and determines how many user stories the team
will accomplish in the first sprint.
The team selects the user stories and develops a sprint backlog.
Step 7: The team works to complete the user story MVP.
Remember that agile sprints are time-boxed.
The norm is fifteen or thirty days.
If the team cannot complete all user story requirements, the team carries the user story
over to the next sprint.
The agile sprints do not extend.
Step 8: The team provides a demo at the end of the sprint for customer feedback.
The product owner refines or updates the product backlog.
The team meets for a retrospective meeting to discuss what went well and what change
makes the most sense to implement in the next sprint.
Step 9: The team continues to repeat this process from Step 6 until the team completes
all sprints to produce a final product

In this video, you learned that:
Artifacts are templates, documents, outputs, or deliverables.
There are three common artifacts:
The product backlog is a list of all project requirements the product owner develops and
maintains,
The sprint backlog is specific tasks from the user story that the agile team develops,
And the product increment is deliverables from each sprint that the team provides to
the customer for feedback.
A user story is the requirement description and acceptance criteria.
The product backlog follows the DEEP model.
The nine-step-by-step overview of the agile project management process.

Project Initiation
Welcome to "Project Initiation" After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize the project initiation phase.
Explain the roles and responsibilities of the project manager.
Describe the project charter and stakeholder register.
And explain the project charter approval process.
The project initiation phase provides an opportunity to define a project for stakeholder approval
and to begin effective project planning.
The steps for correctly initiating the project include:
The problem or opportunity is identified.
The initial business case with a benefits analysis/statement of work (SOW) is approved.
The project charter is developed.
The stakeholder register is developed.
The pre-baseline is approved by stakeholders.
The project charter is approved for planning.
The benefits of using the project initiation phase include:
Ensuring the project meets the organization's needs.
Gaining agreement on project objectives.
Mapping the project to the programs and portfolio.
Identifying and informing stakeholders of responsibilities.
And it authorizes the project manager to proceed to the planning phase.
The key roles project managers must complete in the initiation phase include the following:
Working closely with program and portfolio managers to understand the business needs
and benefits of the project.
Reviewing the business case driving the project, if applicable.
Understanding the role of a business analyst to develop a business case, in the event a
business analyst is not part of the project.
Working with stakeholders to ensure understanding of the project objectives.
And, presenting the project charter to the project sponsor in a "pre-baseline presentation."
Here are the key responsibilities of project managers during the initiation phase.
Developing and staffing key documents for approval, including a business case, project
charter, or stakeholder register.
Determining key stakeholders required to achieve project success.
Also, documenting roles and responsibilities and gaining stakeholder commitment to the project.
Gaining project charter approval before moving to the planning phase.
And, working with the project team to determine if the project adds value to the problem.
A project charter may include an approval or recommendation to defer or cancel a project.
The project charter and stakeholder register are part of a four-step process to achieve
project success.
Steps 1 and 2 define what and why and are accomplished in the project charter.
Step 3 defines who needs to be involved and is accomplished in the stakeholder register.
Step 4 defines how and is accomplished in the planning phase.
The project charter is completed by the project manager in a straightforward process.
Understand the business case and project benefits.
Develop the project charter and stakeholder register with stakeholders.
Present the charter to the project sponsor in a "pre-baseline" presentation with a recommendation
to approve, defer, or cancel the project.
Share the charter with stakeholders and begin project planning.
In this video, you learned that: The project initiation phase defines the project
for stakeholder approval.
The key roles and responsibilities of the project manager during the initiation phase
include: Understanding business needs of the project.
Developing key documents for approval.
Identifying stakeholders and gaining their commitment.
Working with stakeholders to understand objectives.
Presenting a "pre-baseline presentation" to the project Sponsor for approval.
The project charter defines what and why of a project.
And finally, the stakeholder register defines who is involved in the project.

Project Planning

Welcome to "Project Planning"
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the importance of the project planning phase.
Explain the roles and responsibilities of the project manager.
Describe the importance of an organized project planning approach.
And explain the project management plan approval process and kick-off meeting.

The project management lifecycle aligns with the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) methodology.
The project management Institute (PMI) framework outlines forty-nine steps recommended to plan
and deliver a project successfully.
Twenty-four of those steps fall in the planning phase; this is close to fifty percent of the
total project steps!
Planning is critical.
The project manager guides and controls the end-to-end planning process.
The project manager enlists the support of the project team but is ultimately responsible
for the project results.
If the project fails, the project manager is held accountable.
Now, the key responsibilities of the project manager include:
-Ensuring subject matter experts (SMEs) are documented and approved in the project 
charter.
-Documenting personnel support needs in the stakeholder register.
-Ensuring key support personnel have the skills and capacity to support the project.
-Developing and following a comprehensive project management plan.
-Working with the planning team and supporting their needs, including addressing blockers.
-Being inclusive in the planning process.
-Staffing each major part of the plan and getting buy-in before moving forward.

The project management plan consists of a series of smaller plans compiled to provide
an overall view of the project.
Understanding the steps involved in developing a comprehensive project management plan for
the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) test is essential.
Once the Project Charter is approved, the Project Management Plan steps are to
Define the scope, Define the schedule and budget,
Complete support planning, Approve the project plan,
Conduct a kick-off meeting, And create a project baseline.
The first planning step is to plan the scope of the project.
The scope should reflect all requirements listed and approved in the project charter.
Even if there is not enough time and budget to implement the total scope of the project,
we still plan the full scope at this step.
Project managers may conduct negotiations if the scope needs reduction.
And stakeholders and sponsors receive the proposed scope during a "meeting before the meeting."
The next step for the project manager is to develop a project schedule and budget to meet
the total scope needs of the project.
The project manager may need to "balance the triangle" if there is not enough time
or budget to meet the comprehensive needs of the project.
The triangle represents scope, time, and cost.
Project managers negotiate the scope, schedule, and funding to determine an acceptable solution
for project implementation.
The team may need to revisit scope planning to downsize the scope in order to meet realistic
plans and budget resources.
After the project manager develops the scope, schedule, and budget, the project sponsor
signs off on these plans.
Then, the project manager establishes the project scope baseline, the schedule baseline,
and the cost baseline.
The term "baseline" indicates that the project sponsor and critical stakeholders
approve of the plan.
Next, the project manager begins the support planning stage, which is made up of several
planning elements.
The quality assurance (QA) and quality control planning activities ensure the project conforms
to quality requirements.
Resource planning ensures the correct number of resources are available when needed.
Resources primarily include personnel, materials, supplies, and equipment.
Communications planning ensures all team members are aware of their roles and responsibilities.
Project risk management planning ensures risks are known in advance.
Procurement management planning may be needed if third-party support from an external seller
is required to achieve the scope.
And stakeholder engagement planning ensures that stakeholder commitment and engagement
remains high.
The project manager presents the final project plan to the project sponsor.
Then the sponsor will either approve or request revisions to the program.
If the project manager has included the sponsor in the initial planning, it is more likely
that the sponsor will support the plan.
Once the sponsor signs off on the final project plan, the next step is to schedule a kick-off
meeting.
The goal of a kick-off meeting is to share the approved project management plan with
project stakeholders and the project team to gain their approval and commitment to move
the project to the executing phase.
There is no established method to conduct a kick-off meeting.
The PMI states that the meeting is to be scheduled before executing begins.
There are six topics to address in the kick-off meeting.
Project background: Why is the project necessary?  and What is the value of the project?
Project scope: The stakeholders should agree on what will be accomplished by the project,
The timeline,
The risk management plan,
The key roles and responsibilities, And defining the tools, templates, and standards
used in the project.


In this video, you learned that:
The planning phase is critical as it includes twenty-four out of the forty-nine steps to deliver a 
project.
The project manager guides the end-to-end planning process.
And the project management lifecycle plan includes:
The project charter approval, Defining the scope,
Defining schedule and budget, Completing the support plan,
Approving the project plan, Conducting the kick-off meeting,
And creating the project baseline.

Project Executing

Welcome to "Project Executing" After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize the importance of the project executing phase.
Examine roles and responsibilities of the project manager.
Identify skills essential to project executing phase success.
In the project executing phase, also called the implementation phase, the team completes
tasks identified during the previous planning phase.
The executing phase begins when the project management plan is approved by the sponsor
and accepted by key stakeholders.
During this phase, the team produces the product or service which is delivered to the customer.
Certain processes should be followed to ensure a successful executing phase.
The project manager implements the following nine processes during the executing phase:
Acquire resources laid out in the project plan to support the project management plan.
If resources are not acquired, the project schedule may change.
Send statements of work (or SOW) to eligible sellers to find the best fit and develop a contract.
If contracts are not finalized quickly, the schedule may change.
Implement the communications management plan and keep it up-to-date and working, as 
communication requirements will change through the process.
You will learn about the communications management plan in another lesson.
Ensure quality assurance activities are implemented.
Quality assurance (or QA) focuses on preventing issues and defects in the deliverables and
ensures key executing processes and standards are being followed.
And manage project knowledge via status reporting and lessons learned.
The remaining four execution process phases the project manager should follow are:
Assist team members to develop their skills and provide constructive feedback to improve 
performance.
Manage the team and address issues as they occur, and communicate effectively.
Implement risk responses and work with risk owners to recognize when risks occur or about 
to occur.
And finally, maintain stakeholder engagement by implementing strategies to keep 
stakeholders motivated.
The project manager plays a critical role during the executing phase.
The following roles and responsibilities should be followed by the project manager:
Be accessible to the team and meet with them often to be aware of any issues.
Manage effective meetings to ensure communication to the team.
Manage change via the integrated change management system and ensure stakeholders adhere to it
to avoid scope creep.
Conduct and share lessons learned to assist future project managers by recommending solutions
to problems encountered.
And monitor project support activities and ensure key quality, procurement, and risk management
activities are accommodated and completed.
Project management is most critical in the project executing phase for a successful completion.
The project management institute (or PMI) defines 11 key interpersonal skills essential
to success: Effective communication, leadership, motivation,
conflict management, negotiation, coaching, political and cultural awareness, influencing,
decision-making, team building, and trust-building.
In this video, you learned: The project executing phase begins after the
project management plan is approved.
The team produces the product, service, or deliverables during the executing phase.
The key processes of the executing phase.
The roles and responsibilities of the project manager.
And the 11 interpersonal skills identified by the PMI for a successful executing phase.

Project Monitoring and Controlling

Welcome to "Project Monitoring and Controlling" After watching this video, you will be able 
to:
Summarize the importance of the project monitoring
and controlling phase, Describe the integrated change control process,
Examine the roles and responsibilities of the project manager,
And identify essential skills to project monitoring and phase success.
Now, the monitoring and controlling phase begins when the team produces the first 
deliverable.
In this phase, the team verifies that all deliverables meet the specifications the project
manager documents in the project management plan.
In addition, the customer accepts the project deliverables.
Integrated change control is also a part of the monitoring and controlling phase.
Now, there are eight monitoring and controlling phase processes.
The quality control team inspects and verifies each deliverable the team produces.
And the team must correct deliverables with defects before transferring them to the customer.
The project team validates the scope.
The phrase, "The customer is always right," holds true in project management.
The deliverable is not complete until the customer accepts it.
The project manager and team control the scope, schedule, and cost to meet the baseline 
commitments
made in the project management plan.
And the project manager controls resources.
And resource requirements may change as the project progresses.
The project manager must communicate resource needs to the functional managers who oversee
the resources.
Let's now learn about the four remaining monitoring and controlling phase processes.
The project manager monitors communications via the communications management plan, which
is kept up to date throughout the project.
The project manager and team monitor risks.
And risks must be identified and acted upon if they occur.
The project manager controls procurements, communicates with vendors or sellers, and
monitors them to ensure they produce what is outlined in the contract.
And finally, the project manager monitors stakeholder engagement by implementing strategies
to keep stakeholder commitment throughout the project.
The project manager and team develop an integrated change control process to ensure project 
change
management.
If the team does not control change, scope creep may occur.
The integrated change control program is part of the project management plan.
Sponsors and stakeholders approve this plan, and the project manager enforces it.
Stakeholders should commit to following this process to ensure a quality end product.
So, according to the Project Management Institute (or PMI), any project's two primary quality
goals are to conform to requirements and provide a deliverable that is fit for use.
There are three components of an integrated change control program.
Process unique to the project,
Change log,
And change form.
The roles and responsibilities of the project manager during the monitoring and controlling
phase include: Being accessible to the team and meeting often
to stay on top of any issues or defects in the product.
Managing effective meetings to ensure communication.
Quality control and deliverable acceptance meetings are critical during this phase.
Managing change with the integrated management system to ensure all stakeholders adhere to
it.
Sharing periodic lessons learned whether the product is a success or if there are issues.
Ensuring defective deliverables are not given to the customer and identifying and correcting
defects as soon as possible.
To ensure a successful project monitoring and controlling phase, the project manager
must do the following: Perfect the 11 critical interpersonal skills the PMI defines as essential to 
success.
We cover these in another lesson, but as a review, these include effective communication,
leadership, motivation, conflict management, negotiation, coaching, political and cultural 
awareness, influencing, decision-making, team building, and trust-building.
The project manager must also understand and acknowledge external stakeholders' and customers'
needs and develop collaboration skills to ensure a successful interaction with both.
In this video, you learned that: The monitoring and controlling phase begins
when the team produces the first deliverable, The customer accepts deliverables that meet
the specifications in the project management plan.
The integrated change control program has three components:
Process unique to the project, Change log,
And change form.
The project manager and team develop an integrated change control process to ensure project 
change
management, And the project manager's roles and responsibilities
in this phase include the 11 PMI interpersonal skills and understanding stakeholders' and customers' 
needs.

Project Closing

The closing process begins when the project team produces a deliverable, the quality control 
team inspects the deliverable, and the project manager verifies the deliverable as meeting 
specifications from the project management plan.
The project team completes the closing phase input and outputs for all deliverables. The key inputs 
required to begin the closing phase are:
•	The project charter, which defines the objectives of the project. The objectives drive 
project planning and execution. Project managers evaluate deliverables against what the 
project charter describes to ensure no omissions or gaps.
•	Business documents such as the benefits management plan and business case which 
describe the project's anticipated benefits. The project manager assesses whether the final 
project has delivered the intended benefits.
•	The project manager ensures fulfillment of all contract deliverables and settlement of 
final payments, and no actions remain.
•	An authorized agent accepts the deliverables. Possible authorized agents include the 
sponsor, the manager, the client, the customer, or the user.
Once the project team fulfills the input requirements, the project manager focuses on the outputs of 
the phase, which include:
•	The final product transition, the most crucial product or service handoff. The customer 
accepts the product or service, which is now their responsibility.
•	The final report is an overview of what the project team plans to create versus what they 
produce. If there are gaps or omissions, the project manager must address them. This report 
is also an excellent opportunity to thank and praise the team.
•	Lessons learned are critical, as lessons learned provide information to help future projects 
succeed.
Key roles and responsibilities of the project manager
The roles and responsibilities of the project manager during the closing phase include:
•	Staying in constant contact with those who must accept the final product or service and 
identifying and addressing issues when they occur.
•	Being aware of what success looks like and constantly searching for deviations that may 
result in non-conformance and a lack of fitness for use.
•	Ensuring the capability of the subject matter experts who understand the nature of 
contract deliverables and can perform effective vendor management for the project.
•	Beginning to plan the product or service transition on day one of the project. The 
project manager should identify who will accept the transitioned product or service and 
ensure the acceptor is part of the project planning and execution phases.
•	Performing a variance analysis and knowing what the project means to produce. The 
project manager must have an inventory of what the project team produces and address any 
variances as the next steps.
•	Conducting lessons learned.
The Importance of Lessons Learned
The project manager should conduct and document lessons learned after each completed 
project phase or within implementation of a process when it makes sense. The Project 
Management Institute (PMI) states that the primary value of lessons learned is to provide 
information to help future projects be successful. History repeats itself. Lessons learned ensure 
that good history repeats itself or reduces the risk of bad history recurring.
The project manager leads lessons learned, and the project team and stakeholders respond to three 
questions:
1.	What went well?
2.	What could go better?
3.	How can we improve?
The PMI recommends that the organization create a lessons learned register, a document the 
project manager posts in a shared location such as Microsoft Teams or Microsoft SharePoint. The 
lessons learned from multiple projects are available to select managers and team members to 
review.
A second recommendation from the PMI is that the project manager assigns each improvement idea 
to a team member. This team member is responsible for executing the improvement idea. The 
project manager logs the responsible team member and improvement idea into the lessons learned 
register.
Conclusion
Project managers must be able to summarize the importance of the project closing phase, including 
the key inputs and outputs that occur. Project managers should communicate with those who 
accept the deliverables, be aware of what a successful finished project looks like, and conduct 
lessons learned with the project team after the project. Lessons learned prompt the stakeholders 
and project team to determine what went well, what could go better, and how they could improve to 
ensure the success of the future project.

Common Causes for Project Failure
A project manager is expected to see a project through from the beginning to a successful end. 
While no project manager will plan for failure, there are times when a project fails. This article 
describes expected losses and causes and recommends best practices to minimize failure.
Please note that the reasons are not in any specific order.
Scope Creep
Scope creeps a common reason for project failure. Scope creeps a failure to conform to 
requirements. For example, consider a scenario when the project team adds a functionality to a 
deliverable without formal approval from a sponsor or senior leadership. The addition of a new 
functionality can potentially impact the project schedule and budget.
To effectively limit the scope, maintain a well-documented Integrated Change Control system. 
Ensure all stakeholders adhere to the system. A project manager must ensure that the relevant 
stakeholder approves any change or addition to an existing requirement before the project team 
starts working on the need.
Poor Communications
Ineffective communication between team members, other stakeholders, and senior leadership is a 
significant cause of project failure. For example, a project team may not receive communication at 
the right time. Another example is where senior leadership may not receive the correct input. Both 
situations may occur because of team members not freely expressing their concerns.
To ensure effective communication, the project manager must ensure that the proper 
communication at the right time to the right people in the right amount. Also, having a 
Communications Management Plan is critical.
Poor Resource Management
Poor resource management leads to shortages, over-allocation of workload, cost overruns, and 
missed schedules.
To avoid resource issues, a project manager must identify resources essential to project success 
during the Planning process. A project manager must ensure that resources are available when 
required.
Inadequate Stakeholder Management
Far too often, a project manager does not understand different stakeholders' needs. The gap in 
understanding can lead to a shortfall in stakeholder management, which can cause multiple issues 
that can impact project success. As an example, consider a situation where a project has some 
changes to the HR process. Unfortunately, HR was not included in initial project planning and is 
now put into a reactive mode to accomplish their responsibilities.
Make sure to invest time and effort in people, as they are the essential resource on a project.


Poor Estimation
Many project managers estimate time and cost in the ideal time, which rarely materializes. There is 
usually an optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic estimate to consider. According to proven 
statistics, the optimistic estimate occurs on only one in six occasions.
When the estimate is not correct, the associated plan is inaccurate. The inaccuracies can result in 
project failure.
To ensure good estimation, a project manager can leverage various tools, such as three-point 
estimation and top-down estimation, using a work breakdown structure (WBS).
Poor Risk Management
Risk is any potential event that can impact a project. Risk can push a project to failure. Remember, 
"You can manage risk, or it will manage you." If the project team is not able to identify risks at the 
right time, they can become an issue from which the project cannot recover.
There are various strategies to respond to risks. We will cover this subject in detail later in this 
course.
Poor Planning
"If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail." - Benjamin Franklin
Planning is one of the most critical activities and can aid with the project's direction. As mentioned 
earlier, a poor estimation can result in inadequate planning. An incorrect understanding of the 
project deliverables can also result in insufficient planning. Many projects kick off with poorly 
defined objectives. Several times, a project manager may spend minimal time on planning during 
the initial stages of a project. Casual planning can result in issues as the project moves forward. For 
example, some critical tasks may not have been addressed during the initial planning phase. This 
will have a ripple effect on any task. 
A project manager must spend time planning to define SMART objectives in the project charter 
and ensure all stakeholders agree with the project objectives.
Poor Quality Management
Quality is an important aspect of any project. Quality problems can derail them. Most organizations 
have some form of a quality control system. The quality control system allows projects to detect 
quality problems. However, most times the quality problem detection happens towards end of the 
project. Discovering problems when after finalizing a deliverable can impact schedules and budgets 
negatively.
To reduce quality problems, make sure to document and monitor quality requirements. 
Implementing quality assurance can help with identifying problems before they occur.
Project Manager Role: Organization Models
Almost every project in an organization is bound to have a project manager. In some organization 
models, the project manager is part-time, or a technical member might take up project management 
as an additional role. In these scenarios, the overall project results tend to suffer.
For the project manager role to be effective and drive a project to success, organization models 
should encourage good project management. Organizations with formal project management 
methodologies can streamline project management activities and equip project managers with tools 
and best practices for success.
Incorrect Project Lifecycle Selection
Using predictive methods to execute a project when adaptive methods are the best fit, or vice-versa 
can lead to poor results.
For example, using predictive methods when the degree of change is high and the customer expects 
frequent deliveries is a mistake. On the other hand, using agile for a simple project where change is 
low and a single deliverable at the end of the project is expected to be "overkill."
To select the right lifecycle, an organization needs to analyze the project and determine which 
specific lifecycle type is the best fit. After selection, a project manager can plan and implement the 
project.

Communications Basics

Welcome to "Communications Basics."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize the communications model, Define technology factors that can impact
effective communications, And define various communications methods.
The communications model illustrates the complexity of achieving effective communications.
It is essential that the project manager understands the communications model in order to reduce
the risk of poor or inadequate communications that can lead to project failure.
Let's look at four lessons we can learn from the communications model.
Lesson one is to encode each message so the receiver can understand it.
The project manager should ensure that the message sent is the message received.
This requires audience analysis and an understanding of how the receiver prefers to communicate.
Lesson two is to select the correct medium.
Some people prefer to communicate with email, others prefer texts, and some stakeholders
may not respond unless you meet face-to-face.
Lesson three is to ensure that all communications have a purpose.
The project manager should ensure ahead of time what type of feedback they require and
adjust the message as needed.
If no feedback is necessary, the project manager may reevaluate the purpose of the communications.
And finally, lesson four is to be aware of communication blockers.
This is the project manager's greatest communication challenge.
The project manager should identify blockers and plan to overcome them.
Some examples of blockers include culture, language, or the individual's readiness
to receive the communication.
The Project Management Institute (or PMI) identifies technology factors that can jeopardize
effective communications.
First, how urgent is the need to share information?
Project managers should try to avoid the "priority one" syndrome and instead focus on sending
the right information, at the right time, in the right amount, to the right person.
Every message does not need to be urgent.
Second, the availability and reliability of the technology are important.
For example, if the project team uses Microsoft SharePoint, the project manager should ensure
that all key stakeholders have access to this software and understand how to use it.
Third, the project environment plays a big part in effective communications.
The project manager should consider how the project team will accomplish communications.
Face-to-face communications are the most effective.
However, the team may be dispersed in different time zones.
In this case, virtual communications may be the only option.
And finally, project managers should understand sensitivity and confidentiality considerations
by safeguarding communications and ensuring the right audience is targeted.
The PMI identifies three primary communications methods that project managers should 
consider.
Each method requires communications planning and a situational approach.
The first primary communications method is interactive communication.
Interactive communication occurs between two parties and can be very challenging.
The project manager needs to understand the other individual's perspective, preferred
communication style, level of knowledge, attitude, and more.
The second method is push communications.
In this method the project manager sends communications to one or multiple parties without 
receiving
any acknowledgment that the communications were read or understood.
The manager should use this type of communication only after reaching a consensus with 
stakeholders that they understand the purpose of the communication and commit to the process.
And finally, the last primary communication method is pull communications.
Here, the project manager needs to determine and plan for stakeholder communications access
needs.
Pull communications involve access to information by stakeholders on an on-demand basis.
In this video, you learned that: The communications model illustrates four
lessons the project manager should understand to avoid project failure, encoding communications,
using the correct medium, having a purpose, and being aware of blockers
The PMI identifies four technology factors that can impact effective communications,
including urgency, availability and reliability, environment, and sensitivity and 
confidentiality,
And the three primary communications methods managers should consider using are 
interactive, push, and pull communications.

Communications Planning

Welcome to "Communications Planning."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify the importance of effective communications in a project,
Describe a three-step approach to managing communications,
Examine communications management planning techniques,
And identify key communications activities for project success.
Effective communications can make or break a project.
The greater the communications' effectiveness, the higher the potential for project success.
Let's look at the project manager's communication responsibilities throughout the Project 
Management
Institute's (or PMI) lifecycle.
First, project managers should ensure that all stakeholders understand the lifecycle
they will use in the project.
Then, managers should communicate the location of all critical documents and ensure the team
and stakeholders can access them.
Managers should also provide an understanding of project roles, responsibilities, and collaboration
strategies.
Managers are responsible for conducting problem-solving and decision-making communications 
when needed.
In addition, managers should communicate essential tasks to the team and explain the purpose
and value the project deliverables provide to the organization.
Finally, the project manager should ensure all stakeholders understand the current project
status and next steps.
It is important to note that the PMI states that communications impact 90% of a project
manager's job.
If they fail to communicate effectively, the project may fail.
The PMI has a simple but effective three-step process to manage project communications and
this process follows the Plan-Do-Check-Act (or PDCA) methodology.
The first step in this process is to plan communications.
The project manager develops a communications management plan which defines crucial activities,
assigns leads, determines audiences, documents media and timing, and describes the purpose
of the communications items.
The next step is to manage communications.
Once the project sponsor approves the communications management plan, the manager can then 
implement
the plan, and the team can communicate in accordance with the plan.
And the third step in this PDCA methodology is to monitor communications.
In this final step, the team monitors and adjusts communication methods as needed.
The project manager monitors and resolves issues and updates the communications management
plan as the project progresses.
They also assess work performance information and share it in a work performance report.
The communications management plan provides a roadmap and a rhythm to communication.
Let's examine the nine-step process to develop and approve a communications management plan.
In the first step, the project manager determines if the organization uses a standard communications
management plan template.
If so, the manager uses the template.
In step two, the manager and team brainstorm the project.
Since every project is different, the group should determine the essential communications
they must execute to ensure success.
For step three, the project manager must determine whom is included in communications.
A best practice is for the manager to review the project's stakeholder register as a
starting point.
In almost all cases, someone on this register has a role that requires communications.
In step four of developing a communications management plan, the manager documents and
defines the purpose of each communications item and its audience.
In step five, the project manager determines the best team member to manage the communications 
item.
After confirming the role and responsibilities of the item lead with the team member, the
manager adds the assignment details to the plan.
Step six requires the project manager to analyze the audience to determine the most appropriate
communications medium and enter this description into the plan.
Options of communications mediums include email, messenger, virtual, or face-to-face meetings.
For step seven, the project manager determines the ideal frequency for each communications
item and completes the frequency section of the plan.
In step eight, the manager shares a copy of the initial plan with all potential recipients,
confirming that they agree and support the communications items that impact them.
Finally, in step nine, the project manager shares the communications management plan
and ensures version control on past documents, as the plan will require updates throughout
the project.
While every project is different, there are common activities that the project manager
should document in the communications management plan.
Let's look at some examples.
Managers post status reports and identify when and where the project team will hold
meetings.
The sponsor and manager discuss the project status and issues in periodic sponsor one-on-ones.
An essential activity of building a team is team meetings.
The project manager must plan meetings to ensure this interaction happens.
Vendor and change management communications are essential to ensure how project managers
will accomplish vendor management and how they will review and approve change requests.
For larger projects, the team needs to meet periodically to perform risk reassessments,
monitor risks, and share issues that occur and the plans to resolve them.
Some projects require specific meetings to discuss financial status and resource needs.
And finally, resource requirements may change for a variety of reasons, so it's important
that the team periodically meets and validates the resource plan to address shortages and
over-allocations.
In this video, you learned that: The project manager's communications responsibilities
throughout the PMI lifecycle include ensuring stakeholder understanding of the project lifecycle,
communicating documents to the team, conducting problem-solving and decision-making 
communications,
and confirming stakeholder understanding of the next steps.
Communications impact 90% of a project manager's job,
The PMI's three-step process to manage project communications is planning, managing, and
monitoring communications.
There are nine steps a manager should follow to develop and approve a communications 
management
plan, And despite differences in projects, there
are common activities that the project manager should always document in the communications
management plan.


Expert Viewpoints: Communications Planning

Welcome to expert viewpoints, communications planning.
In this video, we will hear from
project managers discussing
how to effectively communicate.
I'm going to talk about two key documents.
One of them is the stakeholder register.
A stakeholder register is a list of key stakeholders that
the project manager or the team should
develop very early in the project.
You identify all stakeholders early,
you assign roles and responsibilities.
The key to this document is to
gain their commitment to support the project.
The second aspect or
document that I want to go ahead and talk
to is what we refer to as
a communications management plan.
Once we get into the planning phase,
what we're going to do is we're going to
take a look at that stakeholder register,
and we're going to determine who
needs to be communicated with.
In the communications management plan,
we defined a number of things.
Number 1, what do we want to communicate?
Number 2, to whom are we going to communicate?
Number 3, when are we going to communicate?
Number 4, how are we going to communicate?
And very importantly, Number 5,
why are we going to communicate
this particular information to the stakeholders?
As a rule, anyone who's on
the stakeholder register should show
up in the communications management plan.
If they're important enough to
have a role and responsibility,
they're important enough to be
able to receive information.
To plan to effectively communicate
with key stakeholders in a project,
it's important to establish
what cadence you want to use first.
For example at the onset of a project,
I like to establish whether or not we'll
be talking in weekly or
bi-weekly or if they need a
larger check-in at any period of the month.
Basically establish what cadence
you want to be able to have.
Then how ingrained into
details and other stakeholders want to be.
At the start of any project.
I always create a communication plan
detailing key stakeholders,
their role, and how and when
they're being communicated to.
The time and the effort I spend on
this always matches the size of
the project and the needs and
the expectations of the stakeholders.
For example maybe a small project might require
just a quick table and
a PowerPoint slide as a communication plan.
But for a big project,
like a product launch moment,
it might require a RACI chart in Excel or in PM software.
That might need formal interviews
conducted across multiple stakeholder groups
to really understand how
your project reports are being
socialized and who depends on them.
Setting up a communication plan for
a project can be a little tricky
because each project may
demand a certain communication tools.
For each project you're working with a different set of
stakeholders and a different set
of people that are actually doing the work.
This is really about stakeholder communication
and really understanding
who your stakeholders are is going to be
an important factor in
figuring out how best to communicate.
Once again, I'm going to point you to
the stakeholder register and communications plan.
But more than just developing them,
you want to go ahead and
have the meeting before the meeting.
Pre coordinate these, makes sure
that anyone who's on the stakeholder register with
a role and responsibility or anyone who is in
the communications management plan realizes that
they have a role to play and there are certain aspects of
communications that they have to be aware of as well.
Have that standard stakeholder
register communications management plan,
and make sure that they are available
and accessible to all of
the different stakeholders as well.
In addition, I'm going to introduce
a new acronym to you, MBWAT.
I learned this a long time ago.
It stands for management by walking and talking.
While MBWAT management by
walking and talking may not necessarily be a tool.
It is a very strong technique.
You can have multiple issues impact you in a project.
If you do not get out and
see the people, visit the stakeholders,
build those relationships,
those issues may catch you by surprise.
In addition, some project managers will try to
manage issues via email. Don't get me wrong.
Email is a great methodology.
However, you can accomplish
more in one face-to-face meeting,
then you probably can through
a number of different emails as well.
I have used different types of software.
I have used Asana,
I have used Smartsheets,
I have in some instances use Jira,
but ultimately you'll want to find
the software that makes sense for you.
My preference for those types of
software is that it's really easy to have
different watchers on specific types of a project.
You can tag certain stakeholders.
You can create reports,
you can create tickets and resolve them from there.
Those are some tools that I like.
It's really important to research and take a look
at tools that you want to use
for your own project as well.
It's hard to recommend a specific tool or
technique for stakeholder communication because clients,
so their needs are always going to be so
different depending on the project and the company.
The best advice that I can give is just to be comfortable
with a wide range of
PM tools so you can adapt to what's needed.
For example I'm a visual person.
I love PowerPoint decks,
but I know that some clients only want to see
numbers in a Power BI report,
and so I cater to their needs.
It's critical to interview clients at the start of
a project to understand what their specific style is.
What do they want to see,
what has worked well for them in the past and why?


Manage Communications - Part 1


Welcome to "Manage Communications - Part 1."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe key communication methods.
And identify key communication challenges.
Managing communications occurs after the communications management plan has been approved.
Note,
The communication plan is discussed in another video.
Communication activities must be effective as the project moves into the execution phase.
There are different communication methods a project manager might need to use on a project.
These include interpersonal communication, small group communication, and large or public
group communication.
The project manager is responsible for selecting methods that meet the needs of the project
and stakeholders.
Let's look at some tips to make these methods effective.
Interpersonal communication is necessary and is an exchange between two individuals.
It is critical to understand various communications styles and needs of all members of the project
team to ensure communications are satisfactory and yield results.
Some stakeholders are analytical and want to get to the point.
Others are structural and want to be organized.
Some may be social and go with the motto "Let's work together."
And some others may be conceptual and say, "Let's explore the opportunities."
Small group communication is also a common method to share information.
And in small group communication, the project manager:
determines who needs to be in a meeting or on a chat.
Invites only those who need to be at the meeting.
Shares an agenda, sets clear goals and objectives, and shares minutes and action items when the
meeting is complete.
Finally, A project manager may need to communicate with a large group or publicly.
Here, careful preparation is essential.
The project manager must ensure the communication portrays information that was reviewed and
serves the needs of the organization.
Methods that work for some stakeholders may not work for others.
They must understand the audience, understand their information needs, and plan communications
accordingly.
We reviewed different communication methods.
Now, let's discuss a few types of communication mediums.
The medium types include face-to-face conversations, instant messaging, emails, and video calls.
Select the medium that best meets the needs of stakeholders.
For example, if team members work remotely, face-to-face is not the best option.
Select a call or a video conference.
You also need to decide if the meeting is impromptu or scheduled.
Remember, a method or medium that works for some stakeholders may not work for others.
Share the right information with the right people using an appropriate medium.
Understand the audience, understand their information needs, and plan your communications
accordingly.
A "one size fits all" communication methodology will not always yield positive results.
While communication must be effective, it is arguably a difficult interpersonal skill
to perfect.
Anticipate communications challenges as the project progresses.
The most common challenges include insufficient competence in communication, inability to
comprehend communication styles and non-verbal communication, dealing with commitment 
issues,
and providing feedback to team members.
Communication competence includes: tailoring communication,
ensuring the purpose of communications is clear,
building effective relationships to enhance communications success,
And displaying proper leadership behavior to support communications.
Strive to improve your communication competence whenever possible.
Since different stakeholders have different communication styles, the PMI recommends that
all project managers consider completing an assessment of their communication style and
be aware of the styles of others.
Also, be aware that messages are not simply conveyed with words.
A project manager also communicates non-verbally through expressions, gestures, and tone of
voice.
Ensure you are aware of your non-verbal mannerisms and take the next step to self-manage them.
The high level of excitement present when a project is initiated often decreases over
time.
A project manager must detect when the team's commitment levels drop and take action to
motivate the impacted stakeholders and team.
A project manager needs to hold stakeholders accountable for commitments to achieve project
goals.
A project manager should provide feedback to the team.
Feedback mitigates the risk of poor performance and accentuates and rewards the positive.
When feedback is not provided, team members assume they are performing adequately when
perhaps performance is lacking.
Remember to provide positive feedback.
Positive feedback reinforces good behaviors and skills and is a great tool for motivating
team members.
In this video, you learned that: Managing communications occurs after the communications
management plan is approved.
Three types of communication methods include interpersonal, small group, and large group
communication.
And, five key communication challenges include communication competence, communication style
comprehension, non-verbal communication comprehension, commitment management, and 
providing feedback.


Manage Communications - Part 2

Welcome to "Manage Communications - Part 2."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain key communication skills essential to succeed.
There are various interpersonal and team skills that are essential to improve communication,
as shared by PMI.
These include conducting effective meetings, active listening, conflict management, 
networking,
and" cultural and political awareness."
Meetings are a constant for a project manager.
Numerous studies cited meetings as a huge time waster in the opinion of managers.
Project managers must learn how to mitigate this risk.
Ensure meetings are well planned, have an agenda with a well-defined outcome, and are
conducted in an organized and efficient manner.
Only have meetings when necessary, and ensure the right people are invited and available.
Active listening is another key to your success.
Techniques that help with active listening include acknowledging the conversation, clarifying,
and confirming that you understand.
Paraphrasing is a great tool to show understanding.
Perfecting your active listening skills will improve the quality of communication, enhance
relationships, and garner additional levels of respect.
Conflict occurs when two or more parties have differing opinions or ideas.
Conflict can be categorized as functional or dysfunctional.
Functional conflict occurs when there are conflicting ideas that, when discussed, lead
to a better solution.
Dysfunctional conflict occurs when conflicting ideas lead to anger, frustration, and lost
time.
Conflict will occur.
A project manager must establish a safe environment where all stakeholders feel free to share
ideas in a constructive manner.
Effective networking provides access to multiple information sources, such as establishing
cross-team collaboration and garnering expertise in the organization from outside the project
team.
Networking helps solve problems and influence stakeholder support.
Understanding the differences between individuals, groups, and organizations is critical.
In addition, recognition of the project environment and power dynamics, both formal and informal,
can impact success.
In this video, you learned that: Five key interpersonal and team skills essential
to effective communications, as shared by PMI, are:
conducting effective meetings, active listening,
conflict management, networking, and
"cultural and political awareness."


Manage Communications, Tools, and 
Techniques


Welcome to "Manage Communications, Tools, and Techniques."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize active listening,
Explain the importance of effective conflict management,
And explain the concept of cultural and political awareness when sharing information.
Active listening is a critical skill essential to effective communication.
Let's look at seven steps that summarize active listening.
This is also a great guide to improve active listening skills.
1-Being attentive.
The project manager should give the other party their full, undivided attention.
2-Asking open-ended questions.
Active listening enables the project manager to learn about various subjects in depth.
3-Asking probing questions.
Understanding the basic premise of the conversation and asking follow-up questions ensures 
effective communication.
4-Requesting clarification.
The project manager should ensure that the message sent was the message received.
5-Paraphrasing.
By repeating what they understood, the project manager can ensure everyone is on the same page.
6-Being attuned to and reflecting feelings.
Project managers should watch the non-verbal cues, listen to voice tone, and reflect passion
where appropriate.
7-Summarizing.
Project managers reflect on the conversation and ensure mutual understanding of the next
steps discussed.
Conflicts will happen and may be caused by resource availability, scheduling, budget,
priorities, personal work styles, personalities, and more.
Proactively recognizing and dealing with conflict can lead to greater productivity and fewer
issues.
Conflict can be both functional and dysfunctional.
Ways to reduce the risk of dysfunctional conflict and encourage functional conflict include:
Setting ground rules and norms, Having a solid and agreed-upon communications
management plan, having well-defined roles and responsibilities, and having productive team 
meetings.
The Project Management Institute (or PMI) states five potential techniques for resolving
conflict.
1-Collaborate-Problem Solve.
With this favoured conflict method, also known as win-win, project managers incorporate multiple
viewpoints, show a cooperative attitude, and strive for consensus and commitment.
2-Compromise-Reconcile.
This technique is not preferred but is often necessary when the collaborate-problem solve
technique is not possible.
Also known as lose-lose, each party receives something with this technique but must also
give up something in return.
Then we have, 3-Force-Direct.
Also known as win-lose, in this technique, one viewpoint is pushed at the expense of
another so that the second party may not have a say in the matter.
This method is preferred during emergencies but should not be the default conflict management
mode.
4-Withdraw-Avoid.
This method is not preferred long-term as it involves retreating or postponing a decision.
This can sometimes be positive as it can reduce emotions and allow for better preparation
to move forward.
Then finally we have 5-Smooth-Accommodate.
The areas of agreement are emphasized rather than the differences.
Needs are postponed to maintain harmony and relationships.
While this technique may be effective in certain situations, it is not long-term.
Project managers should adapt communications to accommodate individual, group, and 
organizational differences and minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication.
The benefits of improving cultural awareness include:
Increasing communication, Increasing respect and understanding of the
advantages a diverse culture can provide, Enhancing the ability to lead effectively,
Improving the workspace environment, And ensuring successful globalization.
Now, a project manager can potentially possess many forms of power.
Some powers are based on position, while other powers must be earned.
This PMI area of focus includes five powers.
1-Formal Authority or Position power is based on the position.
A project manager has authority over the project charter to plan and execute the project and
may request resources for project planning.
2-Reward Power is the project manager's ability to gain support from the team and stakeholders
due to the project manager's ability to provide salary, promotions, or future work
assignments.
3-Penalty power is the project manager's ability to take punitive action when team members
or stakeholders do not perform satisfactorily.
This power should be used sparingly and with caution.
4-The project manager gains expert power when the team and stakeholders perceive the project
manager as knowledgeable.
The team must perceive this knowledge as functional expertise that they consider essential.
Project managers must earn expert power.
And finally, 5-referent power is the ability of the project manager to gain support because the team 
and  stakeholders feel personally attracted to the project manager or the project.
In this video, you learned that: Active listening is a skill essential to effective
communication.
Project managers can reduce dysfunctional conflict and encourage functional conflict.
The five techniques the PMI recognizes for resolving conflict are:
Collaborate-problem solve, Compromise-reconcile,
Force-direct, Withdraw-avoid,
And smooth-accommodate.
Project managers should be culturally and politically aware.
Project managers can possess powers, and we reviewed five powers the PMI emphasizes.


Monitor Communications

Welcome to "Monitor Communications."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize communications monitoring responsibilities.
Summarize effective meeting management techniques.
Describe best practices in virtual communications.
Identify how the Project Management Institute (PMI) Code of Ethics impacts effective 
communications.
Communication requirements change as a project progresses.
The project manager has several responsibilities to maintain good communication practices 
throughout
the project.
We will look at seven responsibilities.
The first three are: Continuing to monitor work performance information
impacting the project and communicating important information out.
Ensuring stakeholders follow the integrated change control process, as all changes must
be approved before implementation to avoid scope creep.
And keeping the communications management plan up to date and ensuring version control
is maintained.
Let's now look at the last four project management communication responsibilities.
Updating the stakeholder register, especially if new stakeholders are identified to support
the project.
Stakeholders whose support is no longer needed should be thanked and removed from the plan.
Managing and updating the issue log and proactively addressing issues.
Issues may be project or personnel-related and include blockers, stakeholder questions,
or problems that need a solution.
Continuing to develop and manage the team with meetings and discussions.
While e-mail is convenient, it should not be the primary communications method.
Face-to-face communication is preferred.
Lastly, conveying the importance of conducting and documenting lessons learned to assist
future projects; communicating successes and disappointments with stakeholders.
Meetings are necessary, and the project manager should ensure all meetings are meaningful
and provide value to participants by following ten meeting rules.
Let's look at the first five meeting rules.
Rule 1: Meeting goals are clear and actionable.
Rule 2: An agenda should always be shared.
A best practice for agendas is the 48/24 rule, meaning the agenda should be sent out 48 hours
prior to the meeting, and the meeting minutes, or notes, should be sent out no later than
24 hours after the meeting.
Rule 3: Publish minutes to act as a reminder on the next steps, and so that action items
are defined.
Rule 4: Share the purpose of the meeting with attendees.
Evaluate who should be at the meeting and who does not need to be.
Some members may be able to review minutes for needed information.
Rule 5: Share materials and pre-work 48 hours before the meeting.
Many meetings fail to achieve objectives due to stakeholders guessing what the meeting
is about during the meeting.
Now, let's look at the remaining five meeting rules a project manager should employ to ensure
meetings are meaningful and valuable.
Rule 6: Provide opportunities to team members to facilitate certain meetings.
Rule 7: Hire a notetaker when comprehensive notes are required to ensure the project manager
can focus on the meeting.
Rule 8: Assign owners to action items and ensure that stakeholders leave the meeting
with an understanding and commitment to accomplishing their tasks.
Rule 9: Practice non-attribution.
A meeting environment should allow stakeholders to feel comfortable and safe sharing ideas
and opinions that may contradict others.
There may be times when stakeholders want to discuss issues not pertinent to the current
meeting.
When this occurs, use what is called a parking lot method to provide a space for comments,
discussions, or questions that are not related to the current meeting's agenda.
By placing these topics to the side, they are not being ignored but will be dealt with
later.
Rule 10: End the meeting early if the objectives are met.
Meet for purpose, not just to fill up time.
Virtual communication requirements are a necessity in today's global environment, where 
stakeholders
and team members may not be able to meet face-to-face.
The Project Management Institute (PMI) recognizes the following best practices for virtual 
communication.
Planning regular and clear communications to avoid communication gaps.
Defining roles and responsibilities early in the project.
Using best meeting practices, such as agendas, and publishing the minutes.
Developing meeting norms and ground rules and sticking with them.
Striving to have a shared vision, outcome, and sense of purpose.
Promoting an open team culture where all team members are listened to, respected, and comfortable
asking others for help.
Building relationships, rapport, and trust.
Understanding team members' perspectives and how they prefer to work.
Using familiar technology and providing technology training when necessary.
Requesting virtual meeting members activate their camera when speaking.
Promoting use of screen-sharing technology.
And finally, using a common repository that all can easily access.
PMI defines four values that drive effective communications in their Code of Ethics, which
are: responsibility, respect, fairness, and honesty.
PMI defines responsibility as "Duty to take ownership for the decisions we make or fail
to make, the actions we take or fail to take, and the consequences that result."
Project managers have a duty to set a positive example and to accept accountability for the
project.
PMI defines respect as "Duty to show a high regard for ourselves, others, and the resources
entrusted to us."
Project managers who show respect for others receive respect in return.
PMI defines fairness as "Duty to make decisions and act partially and objectively."
A project team is a close-knit group.
And project managers should strive to create an environment of fairness.
And finally, PMI defines honesty as "Duty to understand the truth and act in a truthful
manner both in our communication and in our conduct."
Project managers should be honest and truthful to the team.

Expert Viewpoints: Monitoring and 
Controlling Communications

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Monitoring and Controlling Communications.
In this video, we will hear from project managers discussing monitoring and controlling 
communications.
I could probably spend hours on this particular subject, but I'm going to narrow it down
to two key tips.
Tip number one: know your audience.
Not everybody is the same.
Different people have different communication styles.
You, as a project manager, need to understand what that communication style is, how people
are most comfortable communicating, and, whenever possible, try to adapt your style to fit the
needs of the audience.
In addition, adjust your media.
What is the definition of insanity?
You've probably heard this before.
It's doing the same thing over and over again and getting the same unsatisfactory
or poor results.
So, here's a case in point.
Say you send out three emails, and the stakeholder does not respond.
Don't send out that 4th email.
Try a different media to go ahead and reach them.
To ensure the quality of communication remains constant throughout a project, it's important
to establish what cadence of communication you're going to have at the beginning of
the project, whether that means scheduling daily stand-ups, weekly check-ins, larger
check-in meetings after having weekly check-ins.
It is up to you and the rest of the project stakeholders, but it's important to ultimately
establish what that cadence is going to be and stick through it and then in order to
make sure that that cadence is stuck through, it's helpful to have those reoccurring meetings
set from the beginning.
Just put it on the Google Calendar so that are recurring meeting time and it's there
and then with that, I also like to include writing meeting notes, so I use Google Docs,
and within that I'd like to have all of our meeting notes in there for every single
time that we meet with our vendors and stakeholders.
So we have a record of what we've discussed and then it also gives us a good template
to follow through for the rest of our meetings.
It's also really helpful to have weekly email check-ins as well.
I find.
It's good to send and end of the week recap that just runs through what the accomplishments
are, what any blockers are.
If there are any blockers, what are we doing to solve for those blockers and also, call
out if there's any piece of the project that needs to be escalated.
When you have a communication plan, it can be very easy to let that communication plan
slip as a project is, you know, well underway.
And people are doing their jobs and they get a sense of what's happening.
You might find yourself, particularly over a couple of milestones in a project repeating
the same information.
I'm going to send out the status report.
Nothing has really changed because our milestones are a couple of weeks out.
So we're having the same, essentially the same, information over and over again, and
that can get a little tedious, but what it does do, I think, is build discipline.
So, if you have a plan, I'm going to send out status twice a week.
You send.
You should send out status twice a week if you are going to do a daily recap of the day's
work.
Do a daily recap of the day's work and just be disciplined about it, and sometimes if
the information hasn't changed that much, you can copy and paste from the last status
report and then just make minor modifications as needed.
The other technique that I found that really helps is that as soon as I send out a status
report, I start the next one.
So I'll create a template if it's a Word document or even if it's a message you know
something in a message board.
I'll start something in a notepad in, a digital notepad, and I'll start my next
status report.
And as things change in that, whatever that cadence is for your communication.
As things change, I write them down, and then by the time it's, you know that the the
moment comes to send out the next status report, you've essentially created it because you've
been doing it over the course of a few days.
To make sure that everything is consistent with communication throughout a project, it's
great to already have processes in place.
This is where your PMO organization is super helpful for you.
First off, if you already have pre-planned out templates on what your status reports
will look like, your weekly reports, whatever it might be, or even presentations.
That way, everyone already knows what they're expecting.
When you have that expectation, they're able to easily reference it for a future,
and they know it's coming.
Be timely about your communications as well.
If I'm using data as part of my communications, I like to always make sure that I'm pulling
that data from the same place so that week after week, my data points don't look different.
I'm not reporting on man hours one week and team hours another week, or I'm not
reporting on number of tasks done versus number of project objectives met.
I'm always constantly communicating the same data and the same information to the
stakeholders.
So again, they know what to expect.
They know what to look for.
They can think through what questions that they want to ask.
And it just helps keep the quality of the communications consistent.
The stakeholder register and communications management plan.
As the project evolves, things are going to change.
Stakeholders are going to come, and they're going to go ahead and go.
The different communication requirements early in the project are going to change as the
project progresses.
Stay abreast of those changes, update your stakeholder register, update your communications
management plan, and make sure that all of the key stakeholders are aware of those adjustments
and updates.
In addition, people are people.
Sometimes, personal issues are going to occur.
As a project management manager, going back to MBWAT: management by walking and talking,
you need to get out and meet people.
If there is an issue, chances are pretty good that issue is not going to come to you.
Sometimes you have to go out and find it.
And in addition, if you suspect that there are going to be some personnel issues some
resource challenges, have a backup plan.
Do your best to go ahead and support your people, but also have a backup plan just in
case to go ahead and support your project.
Number one is a lack of commitment.
This is a huge risk.
You need to take time to determine the required levels of commitment from each particular
stakeholder and then determine a strategy to go ahead and get them to where they may
need to be.
There may be some stakeholders that only require support.
There may be others who need to be leading.
You need to identify what that level of commitment is, and those strategies that you employ need
to be effective in moving them in that right direction.
Number two: poor collaboration.
Again, develop that stakeholder register, develop that communications management plan.
Make sure that all of the key stakeholders understand their roles and responsibilities
and commit to these roles and responsibilities before you finalize that particular document.
[08:37] Make sure that they understand it.
And make sure that they're ready to go ahead and commit and follow through so that you
can meet the goals of the project, you can meet your needs, and you can meet their needs
as well.
I think it's worth saying that you don't want to do too much in a communication plan
because if you are going to remain consistent, the more you overburden your communications,
the more difficult it is going to be to do it regularly and consistently.
The more you overburden your communications, the more difficult it's going to be to do
regularly and consistently.
So if your communication plan always involves taking a number of screenshots or filling
out a spreadsheet and creating a Word doc and you're trying to do that multiple times
a week or even once a week.
The more friction that you put in front of yourself for your communication plan, the
less you're going to be inclined to do it.
So I would say, you know, you can also mitigate risk by keeping your plan fairly simple, fairly
succinct, and concise, and that will also help you remain consistent so that it's
easy to do if you can template things, whether it be a document or a slack message, or even
a spreadsheet.
Keep it templatized, and then you'll just easily fill in those lines in a spreadsheet
or fill in that template in a document.
To make sure communication is effective, it must be clear.
Unclear messages just cause miscommunication from there.
Also, we have a lack of transparency.
Give a responsible, reasonable timeline.
If you're saying it's going to be done next week, and it's really going to be done
about a month from now because there's potential risks that are involved, do not say it's
going to be next week just to make your boss happy.
Lack of responsiveness.
This is a huge one.
Communication has to be an open door, and it also has to be done timely.


Module 2 Summary and Highlights: 
Information Sharing: Communications
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:
•	The basic communications model stresses the importance of ensuring that the project team 
receives messages as intended and introduces the concept of communication blockers, which 
are factors that can obstruct effective communication. It is crucial to identify these blockers 
before they impact the team. The Project Management Institute (PMI) also identifies 
technology factors the project manager should analyze and plan for, as these factors can 
affect communications. Finally, the project manager should consider different 
communication needs, such as pull, push, and interactive communications, when planning 
for effective communication in each project.
•	Communications planning emphasizes the significance of effective communications in 
achieving project success. You now know the three-step approach to managing 
communications and reviewing communications management planning techniques. The PMI 
states that communications are 90% the project manager's responsibility and should be a 
central focal point as you plan and execute a project. Every project should have a 
communications management plan, as a lack of communications planning will likely result 
in random and ineffective communications. The communications management plan should 
contain key communication activities crucial for project success.
•	How to implement a communications management plan. You now know the essential 
communication methods, challenges, and skills a project manager should possess. The PMI 
states communication is the most difficult interpersonal skill to perfect, so you should hone 
your skills whenever possible.
•	The key tools and techniques essential to effective communication include active listening, 
conflict management, and how political awareness is vital when sharing information.
•	Communications monitoring responsibilities include effective meeting management 
techniques, best practices in virtual communications, and how the PMI Code of Ethics 
impacts effective communications.

Identify Stakeholders

Welcome to "Identify Stakeholders."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify potential questions from a stakeholder perspective at the time of the project proposal.
Summarize the purpose of a stakeholder register.
Explain the structure of a stakeholder register.
Describe the key tools and techniques used to identify stakeholders.
And, explain the steps to effectively identify stakeholders and gain commitment.
After the initial project proposal phase, there are four questions on the minds of stakeholders.
These questions need to be answered in a logical order to move forward with the project.
Questions one and two are basic including, "What is the project?" and "Why does
the project matter?"
The project stakeholder can find answers to these questions in the project charter.
Question three is, "Who are the stakeholders?"
Stakeholders include customers, end-users, sponsor, team, subject matter experts (SMEs),
and so on.
A project stakeholder can find answers related to stakeholders in stakeholder register.
The final question is "How will we execute the project?"
A detailed response to this question can be found in the project plan that a project manager
creates during the planning phase.
Let's now understand the purpose of the stakeholder register.
A stakeholder register is a critical project document that includes stakeholder details,
such as name, role, areas of expertise, and so on.
The stakeholder register forms an input into various project activities including project
planning, communications, and project governance.
A project manager must create a stakeholder register at project initiation in conjunction
with the project charter.
When the sponsor and senior management approve the project charter, the project manager 
also finalizes the stakeholder register.
The project charter and stakeholder register enable the project manager to start with the
project planning phase.
Most project managers develop a stakeholder register using Microsoft Excel or Word and
can be in tabular format.
The stakeholder register captures several key pieces of information.
Let's review the required information.
Identify each stakeholder by name.
There might be times when the project manager may not know the name of the stakeholder.
For example, if the project manager has not been able to identify and assign a SME to
the project, leave the name blank.
Specify the organization name which is important when multiple organizations, including 
contracting
agencies, participate in the project.
Note, you can ignore this detail for small projects with one organization.
Provide a brief description of the role that the stakeholder plays in the project.
List the responsibilities using RACI designators.
Let's review the designators.
R indicates Responsible.
The stakeholder will take the responsibility of completing the specified project work or
tasks.
A represents Accountable.
The stakeholder will be held accountable for certain work on the project.
Accountable implies that the stakeholder needs to ensure the work is accomplished, though
they may not necessarily perform the work.
C indicates Consult.
The stakeholder must be available to provide expertise and guidance.
And I indicates Inform.
The stakeholder will be informed about the specified work as the project progresses.
And the final key piece of information on the stakeholder register is Comments.
Document additional information, references, or clarification, which are helpful to the
project.
There are a number of tools and techniques used to identify stakeholders.
Here are a few recommended by the Project Management Institute, or PMI.
Expert judgment is a technique where the project manager consults with experts who can 
share the stakeholder requirements for the project.
Identification meetings are another technique. Invite all stakeholders that might be impacted by or 
interested in the project. Strive to have a representative for each stakeholder group.
Stakeholder mapping is a technique to identify stakeholders based on their relative power
and interest in the project.
The stakeholder mapping technique places each stakeholder into one of four quadrants and
provides management guidance for each.
Note, if you plan to attempt the CAPM exam, you must know this model.
Document analysis is another PMI recommended technique.
Review initial project documents, such as business case, contracts, and Service Level
Agreements. You will discover stakeholders in these documents.
PMI recommends using brainstorming as a technique to identify stakeholders.
Use brainstorming to pose a question and facilitate the free flow of ideas.
We discussed the tools and techniques that PMI recommends for identifying stakeholders.
Let's now review the steps to develop and communicate the stakeholder register to all
stakeholders.
The first step is to determine stakeholders by using PMI recommended tools and techniques.
Next, complete the initial stakeholder register.
Document the key components, such as name, organization, and role.
Then, analyze each role in terms of responsibilities using RACI designators.
Some stakeholders may have a single responsibility, such as "R" or "C" while other stakeholders
may have multiple responsibilities, such as "RC"
The next step is to have the "meeting before the meeting."
Collaborate with each stakeholder to determine if they can satisfy the role and responsibilities
assigned.
Document any issues, such as limited capacity, in the Comments section.
After documenting the details, share the stakeholder register with the sponsor.
Make sure to get confirmation from the sponsor on the stakeholder details before moving to
the planning phase.
If what, why, and who questions are answered, and the project remains feasible, move to
the planning phase.
In this video, you learned that: Questions asked after project proposal include:
"What is the project?"
"Why does this project matter?"
"Who are the stakeholders?"
And, "How will we execute the project?"
The purpose of a stakeholder register is to capture stakeholder information.
The stakeholder register captures several key stakeholder details including name, 
organization,
role, responsibility, and comments.
Responsibility is captured using RACI designators: Responsible
Accountable Consult
And Inform PMI recommends using various tools and techniques
to identify stakeholders including: Expert judgement
Identification meetings Stakeholder mapping
Document analysis And Brainstorming
And finally, follow the recommended process to develop and communicate the stakeholder
register.
Plan Stakeholder Engagement

Welcome to "Plan Stakeholder Engagement."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize the purpose of a stakeholder engagement plan.
Explain the structure of a stakeholder engagement plan.
Describe key strategies to receive desired stakeholder commitment.
And explain why a stakeholder engagement plan is a close-hold plan.
Planning stakeholder engagement is essential for project success.
The stakeholder engagement plan documents current and desired levels of engagement for
key stakeholders identified in the stakeholder register.
In addition to engagement levels, the stakeholder engagement plan outlines strategies to help
sustain positive levels and move other stakeholders to expected levels.
Project managers develop a stakeholder engagement plan using Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word,
or Microsoft PowerPoint.
A stakeholder engagement plan should be in tabular format, and captures key information,
like the following.
A key entry is the stakeholder name or position.
Remember that not all stakeholders on the stakeholder register need to be annotated
in the stakeholder engagement plan.
The stakeholder engagement plan targets critical stakeholders who are generally external or
not directly associated with project planning.
Another key piece of information is the current level of commitment.
The Project Management Institute, or PMI, provides recommended commitment levels.
Five commitment levels include Unaware, Resistant, Neutral, Supportive, and Leading, as 
documented in the Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix tool from PMI.
The project manager maps the current commitment levels of key stakeholders in each phase 
of the project management lifecycle.
For example, if the stakeholder is not open to committing to the project work, map them
to commitment level, Resistant.
Or if a stakeholder must influence others to commit, map the stakeholder to commitment
level, Supporting.
Also include the desired commitment level from the stakeholder to support project objectives.
Finally add strategies to sustain or achieve desired levels of commitment in the stakeholder 
engagement plan.
Now, let's look at some strategies recommended by PMI to engage stakeholders and gain 
commitment.
Influencing is a critical interpersonal skill to engage stakeholders.
For example, if a project manager is able to influence a resistant stakeholder with
project values, there is a greater possibility of that stakeholder becoming supportive.
Engage stakeholders early.
The project manager should engage with stakeholders as soon as the stakeholder register is 
approved.
Late identification often leads to frustration, anger, or lost support.
Another strategy is to share and discuss the project charter with stakeholders.
Ensure all key stakeholders review the project charter.
When stakeholders understand project objectives and value, commitment often increases.
Asking questions is another strategy.
Ask relevant questions and try to understand the perspective of other stakeholders.
Use active listening skills.
Some inputs may be valuable, while others may not.
Be open to suggestions and improvements.
Getting stakeholders to collaborate is another good strategy.
Collaboration helps address issues as early as possible.
For example, capacity issues may be discovered through a simple conversation or meeting,
Integrity is another strong strategy.
Lead with integrity.
Commitment may follow.
For example, if you set a positive example, others may follow.
Include stakeholders in planning.
Share scope, schedule, and budget recommendations before the project management plan is 
presented.
Keep people informed and avoid surprises.
Surprises can lower commitment levels.
Build the team.
An effective project manager works with the team to identify issues and lagging commitment
levels.
For example, a team member will disclose more in a simple conversation than in numerous
e-mails.
Manage expectations.
Clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well-defined and value-added project objectives
go a long way to help gain commitment.
Look for triggers early that may lead to lowered commitment.
Rewards matter.
Recognize stakeholders who perform at a high level.
If your budget is limited, at minimum, say "Thank You."
And finally, communicate effectively.
Remember, communication is 90% of a project manager's job.
Effective communication is often the difference between sustained or lost commitment.
The stakeholder engagement plan is a unique document that must be accomplished.
At the same time, the stakeholder engagement plan is only shared with select stakeholders.
Why only select stakeholders?
The answer is that many stakeholders might take offence if they are publicly documented
as resistant or neutral.
Hard feelings can develop, and bridges may be burned that can never be repaired.
The stakeholder engagement plan, therefore, needs to be close-hold and only used by the
project manager and core project team.
In this video, you learned that: The stakeholder engagement plan contains key
stakeholder engagement details including current and desired commitment levels and 
engagement strategies for key stakeholders.
The stakeholder engagement plan can be in tabular format using Microsoft Excel, Word,
or PowerPoint Strategies for engagement include:
Influencing Direct impact on stakeholders
Engage early Share and discuss
Ask questions Collaborate
Integrity Involvement
Build a team Manage expectations
Rewards Effective communication
The stakeholder engagement plan is a close-hold document and is only shared with select 
stakeholders.


Manage Stakeholder Engagement
This article will teach you the importance of managing stakeholders and why stakeholder 
commitment levels may be low.
The importance of effectively managing stakeholders
The Project Management Institute (PMI) identifies critical success factors that underscore the 
importance of effective stakeholder management.
•	Defining roles and responsibilities and sharing and confirming expectations with the 
stakeholders as early as possible in the project is critical. The earlier you onboard and set 
expectations with stakeholders, the more effectively they will perform.
•	Sharing the project's values and benefits with stakeholders can help overcome 
resistance and encourage project commitment. It would be best if you showed how the 
project would benefit the individual stakeholders and the organization.
•	Planning effective meetings to collaborate and lead brainstorming, focus groups, 
problem-solving, decision-making, and other key communications. Meetings should 
achieve value-driven outcomes and be purposeful for all attendees.
•	Using the most appropriate communication channels to conduct stakeholder 
communications. Try to use channels that accommodate the needs of the audience.
•	Practicing active listening to understand stakeholder perspectives and motivational 
factors better.
•	Understanding different stakeholders have distinct communications. Adapt your 
communications approach to meet stakeholder needs whenever possible.
Reasons why stakeholder commitment levels are low
There are a few pitfalls to avoid that may reduce project stakeholders' commitment levels:
•	Failure to identify stakeholders early in the project. Project managers must understand 
the importance of all stakeholders and the role each stakeholder plays in the project. Work as 
a team to identify all key stakeholders and engage with them as early as possible.
•	Not meeting the stakeholder's needs and expectations. Communication is a two-way 
street. A project manager should set expectations. However, the project manager must also 
understand and meet the expectations of stakeholders as well. Communicate the project's 
purpose, be transparent, and accept accountability for your actions. Ensure stakeholders do 
not feel ignored.
•	Failure to acknowledge stakeholders' powers and interests and underestimating their 
influence and impact. Avoid a one-size-fits-all engagement methodology. Treat each 
stakeholder as unique and use a situational engagement strategy.
•	Inadequate issues management. Project managers define issues at the stakeholder level as 
problems, blockers, or questions impacting the successful completion of commitments. A 
project manager must proactively identify issues before they drastically impact the project.
•	Poor communication leads to misinformation and uncertainty. When the message sent is 
not the message the stakeholder receives, it can damage the relationship and jeopardize 
project success.

Expert Viewpoints: Stakeholder Management 
Tools

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Stakeholder Management Tools.
In this video we will hear from Project Managers discussing Project management tools.
What are some common tools and techniques you use to effectively manage stakeholders?
Hello again everyone.
My name is Dan Yeomans, and today I have the pleasure of sharing a few more questions and
answers that are pertinent to your project management journey through this particular
course.
The first question I want to go ahead and respond to is, what are some common tools
and techniques you use to effectively manage stakeholders?
The first one, and you've probably heard this before if you've listened to any of
my prior interviews, is a stakeholder register.
This is the one of the first documents that you go ahead and create.
A stakeholder register is a list of key stakeholders who are essential to the success of the project.
A stakeholder register lists all of these key stakeholders by name or position and assigns
them a designator using RACI terminology.
R stands for responsible.
Who are the stakeholders who are going to be required to do the work?
A is accountable.
Who are the stakeholders who are going to be accountable for the final results of the
deliverable or the project as a whole?
C stands for consult.
Who are those subject matter experts whose expertise you're going to be dependent upon
to complete the project successfully?
And I is informed.
Who are those individuals who require information that you're going to go ahead and keep in
the loop?
The second document that I want to go ahead and share is a stakeholder engagement plan.
What we do with the stakeholder engagement plan is we take this list that we had on the
stakeholder register of the key stakeholders.
And then, we assign them a designator in terms of their current level of commitment and their
desired level of commitment, or your desired level of commitment that is required for them
to successfully satisfy the needs of the particular project.
We take the current level of commitment and desired level of commitment, and we analyze
where they're at and where they need to be.
And we develop strategies that we will implement a little bit later in the project.
The Project Management Institute has five categorizations that they often use for the
current and desired level of commitment.
One of them is U - unaware.
If someone's unaware, you develop a strategy to make them aware.
Another is resistant.
If someone is resistant, normally, you want to spend a little bit of time sharing the
benefit of the project, the value proposition of the project, and hopefully try to win them
over.
Someone who is neutral, which is coded as N, is someone who's on the fence.
They see some merit in the project, but they also see some problems in the project.
Go ahead and embrace the merit and try to go ahead and dispel the problem.
S stands for supportive.
This is someone who supports the project, who's willing to go ahead and do what it
takes to evangelize the project, and L is (7) leading.
These are people who are actually going to be required to actually do something for the
project.
Hi, my name is Paul Pardi.
I've had a few titles in my career.
I've served as a software development manager as well as a content manager
for some fairly large teams, and while I've never had the role of project manager per
SE, I've done a lot of project management in both of
my roles, and so a lot of my work involved in ensuring that my team was on track and
motivated that they knew what their schedules and deliverables
were and then ensuring that once those deliverables were met, that I was communicating
with upper management.
So did a lot of the same roles and some of the same tasks as a project manager.
In my experience, tools that work the best in managing stakeholders have been something
as simple as a spreadsheet.
Seems like everybody can knows how to read spreadsheets.
Most people know how to read spreadsheets today.
There's a lot of new tools that have come out in some of the team management software
like Microsoft Teams.
Even Slack has, like a lot of interesting stakeholder management tools, that allow you
to communicate broadly to an audience and collaborate with stakeholders so they can
update documents or rows in a spreadsheet or even little widgets on a page.
Task widgets, so those tools can be effective.
However, you know it really depends on the stakeholders that you're working with, how
inclined they are to use technology.
And whether they're technical, that can be a little bit polarizing.
If you have a team or stakeholders that are not technical.
In terms of techniques, I've found you know you want to work with your stakeholders as
partners.
Generally, when I set up a project, I try to ensure that it's not the project manager
trying to drive everybody to get the project done or it's not the project manager that
is, you know, kind of antagonistic with the stakeholders, right?
What I try to do is is ensure that, you know, we're all on the same side working towards
the end goal.
And the enemy is not with the stakeholders.
The enemy is not what the team the enemy tends to be time.
The enemy tends to be money, and all of us together, the stakeholders, the people doing
the actual work, and the project manager are on the same side against those things that
can cause friction and cause problems.
And I try to set that up early so that if I encounter a problem in the project, I can
go to the stakeholders and say, how are we going to solve this?
I
Hello, my name is Kathern Brooks.
I'm an engineering project manager at Techsystems for
Apple.
I am a PMP and my MBA from UNC Chapel Hill.
I have 12 years' experience.
To effectively manage stakeholders, first, I use communication planning methods.
Then stakeholder mapping and engagement plans,
and risk and issue plans.
Hi, my name is Erica Maldonado, and I'm a program manager at Coursera.
To plan to effectively communicate with key stakeholders in a project, it's important
to establish what cadence you want to use first.
So, for example, at the onset of a project, I like to
establish whether or not we'll be checking in weekly or biweekly or if they need a larger
check- in at any period of the month, basically established
what cadence you want to be able to have.
And then how ingrained in the details other stakeholders want to be.
And some specific tools and techniques that I like to use.
I have used different types of software.
I have used Asana.
I have used smart sheets.
I have, in some instances, use JIRA, but ultimately, you'll want to find the software
that makes sense for you.
My preference for those types of software is that it's really easy to have different
watchers on specific types of a project, so you can tag
certain stakeholders.
You can create reports.
You can create tickets, and resolve them from there,
so those are some tools that I like.
It's really important to research and take a look at tools
that you'd want to use for your own project as
well.
What are common stakeholder management challenges you encounter, and how do you overcome 
them?
I want to talk about two areas briefly.
Number one: issues management.
What is an issue?
An issue is a problem or a question that a stakeholder has that is a potential blocker
and is stopping them from doing what they need to do.
And motivation and commitment.
What is motivation and commitment?
Motivation is that passion from within that drives you to do the right thing, to do what
you need to do to support the project.
And commitment is your ability to go ahead and stick with it.
So, let's go ahead and talk about issues first.
First of all, where there are issues-you may not find them.
Oftentimes issues come to you very late, and you have to be very, very reactive and try
to figure out how to solve them.
Try to interact with the team as much as possible.
Face-to-face is best, but if you can't meet people face to face, in a virtual
environment, at minimum, strive for voice contact.
Sometimes a face-to-face meeting or just a quick
conversation will help you to understand what some of those issues are.
Whereas if you're strictly reliant upon e-mail or other technical systems
such as that, you may not get the information until it's
too late.
And in terms of motivation and commitment, there is a term called WIIFM.
It stands for: What's In It For Me.
One of the things that you really want to do in these face-to-face meetings or voice-to-voice
meetings is continually remind stakeholders of the value of the project, both to the organization
and to them as well.
Try to do everything in your power to get stakeholders a reason to stay the course and
care.
And again, that comes in two ways.
Some people are very organizationally focused.
How is this project going to help the organization?
Others are individually focused.
How is this project going to allow you to grow and to enhance your career?
What are common stakeholder management challenges you encounter, and how do you
overcome them?
Stakeholder management, mistakes, and barriers that I definitely have encountered in my previous
projects.
One would be communication barriers.
By using multiple communication channels, you're able to actually break down a lot
of those barriers, make sure it works best for that particular stakeholder.
Lack of alignment or conflicting interest by minimizing these had a clear stakeholder
strategy plan.
Lack of engagement.
This has honestly been the biggest one that I've run into with very large stakeholders
like leadership.
Either it's the customer leadership, personal leadership, make sure
to provide regular updates.
Engage the stakeholders when needed and in a meaningful way.
So, if it's a decision-making process that's going to really
impact the project, pull them in.
In my experience, the biggest problem that I've had in dealing with and working with
stakeholders has been stakeholders feeling like the the people involved in the project
are working against each other, so there's a lot of times where you're working on a
project and one stakeholder will have a specific point of view or a specific set of goals,
and that point of view or those goals are opposite or different than other stakeholders
on the team.
So, you know, in those situations, what you what you try, what I try to do is really try
to find that common ground.
Go back to first principles.
What are we?
What are we building this for?
So it's it's using those techniques to really try to
get people to work in the same direction rather than seeing each person on the team as
antagonistic, and if you do encounter a situation where you can't get your stakeholders to
agree, that's probably time to bring it to the next level of conversation with upper
management or with other people that can help make those decisions.

Monitor Stakeholder Engagement

Welcome to "Monitor Stakeholder Engagement and Ground Rules."

After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize methods to maintain stakeholder support,
Describe the Tuckman Ladder and situational leadership model,
And recognize key motivation theories to shape stakeholder engagement strategies.
Maintaining stakeholder support and commitment through the planning and execution of a project
can be difficult.
The project manager should always collaborate effectively to keep stakeholders moving in
a positive direction.
A project manager must be able to organize the project, be an effective communicator,
be a positive influencer, and be accessible to the team and stakeholders.
In 1965 Bruce Tuckman developed the Tuckman Ladder and this ladder shares a four-step
process for team development.
Then, Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard developed the Situational Leadership Model in 1982.
And this model shares strategies to gain commitment and support depending on an 
individual's readiness state.
We combine these two models to adopt a successful approach to building a team.
When a team first comes together, productivity is low and it takes time to move the team
to a state where productivity is high.
Let's look at the stages the team moves through and how the project manager can guide the
team to success.
First, the team comes together in the form stage of the Tuckman Ladder.
Project managers should use a tell strategy (of the Situational Leadership Model) by telling
the team what the project is, why it's important, and explaining the roles and responsibilities
of each team member.
Next, In the storm stage of the ladder, team members may begin to have doubts and feel
the project is not a good fit for them.
They may have reservations about their skills, roles, and responsibilities and questions
about the project itself.
Productivity is low during the storm stage.
Here, a project manager should employ a sell strategy of the Situational Leadership Model
by selling the team on the project and selling the team on themselves.
By addressing areas of doubt, answering questions, and assuring team members that they 
have value and belong, a team can weather the storm stage.
In the norm stage of the ladder, the team begins to focus on project work, and productivity 
increases.
Now the team may still have questions and some reservations.
The project manager should cease using the telling and selling strategies and switch
to a participate strategy by being available, accessible, and ready to support the team.
Finally, productivity peaks in the perform stage of the ladder.
The team can now self-organize and self-direct themselves.
The project manager should use a delegate strategy and allow the team to work independently
and self-correct.
If an issue occurs, the project manager can repeat any of the rungs on the Tuckman Ladder.
The Project Management Institute (or PMI) shares four motivational theories that a project
manager should understand and leverage to motivate their team.
The first of the four motivational theories is the Expectancy Theory.
The team evaluates the work depending on the level of effort it will require to accomplish it.
If the potential reward justifies the level of effort, the team member performs at a high
level.
However, if the reward does not justify the level of effort, the team member's performance
may not be adequate.
The second theory is the Hertzberg Hygiene and Motivational Factors theory.
This theory was developed by Frederick Hertzberg, who categorizes motivation as hygiene and
motivational factors.
Hygiene factors, such as company policies, salary, and the work environment, decrease
motivation if they are absent.
Motivational factors, such as achievement, growth, and advancement opportunities, increase
motivation when they are present.
Now, the third theory is Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivation.
Daniel Pink developed this theory in which he categorizes motivational factors as being
either extrinsic or intrinsic.
Extrinsic motivators are short-term and diminish over time, such as salary.
Intrinsic motivators are broken into three categories:
Autonomy, which is the desire to direct one's own life,
Mastery which is the ability to improve, learn, and excel,
And purpose, which is the need and desire to make a difference.
And the fourth theory is the Theory of Needs.
David McClelland states that people are generally motivated by three needs: achievement, power,
and affiliation.
The strength of these three needs in an individual varies depending on the individual's experiences,
values, and culture.
In this video, you learned that: A project manager must be able to organize
the project, be an effective communicator, be a positive influencer, and be accessible
to the team and stakeholders.
The Tuckman Ladder Model states that teams move through the form, storm, norm, and 
perform stages.
A project manager employs the Situational Leadership Model - tell, sell, participate,
and delegate strategies through each ladder stage to keep their team on task.
The four motivational theories are:
1-The Expectancy Theory,
2-The Hertzberg Hygiene and Motivational Factors Theory,
3-The Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Motivation Theory
4-The Theory of Needs.

Expert Viewpoints: Ground Rules and Norms

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Ground Rules and Norms.

In this video, we will hear from Project Managers discussing Ground Rules and Norms. They 
explain when using ground rules is most beneficial, examples of successful implementation of 
ground rules and norms, and advice for when stakeholders fail to follow ground rules and norms.
Well, the Project Management Institute came up with a tool called a team charter. And within
this team charter, they define six different areas where ground rules and norms are probably
quite important. I want to go ahead and pick the two that I think are really important.
Number one, meeting norms. Let's be honest. Meetings are a huge time waster.
Try to get with your team and determine what are norms and ground rules that will ensure that
your team applies effective meeting management.Here's a couple of quick examples.
Number one, publish an agenda. A meeting without an agenda is like a journey without a road 
map. And publish the minutes. Ensure there is a record of discussions and action items. Without 
minutes,
you may very well encounter a term that I like to refer to as "selective amnesia."
What does "selective amnesia" mean? It means that the next day the individual who made
commitments at the meeting has no understanding or remembrance of the commitments that they 
made.
I want to go ahead and close out meeting ground rules with a rule that I was informed of that I
really think is good. It's the rule of 48/24. Get the agenda out 48 hours ahead of time. Why
48 hours? It gives people enough time to go ahead and do the pre-work and to try
to understand what this meeting is all about. And get the minutes out within 24 hours of the
end of the meeting to avoid that "selective amnesia" that I just shared a moment ago.
The second area: team values. I like to refer to team values sometimes as the elephant in the room.
Ensure you treat each other with respect, and here's the key. Respect may mean
different things to different people. When you're determining what those ground rules and norms 
are, define what respect means to the team. What does it mean to the group? Come up with a 
standard definition that everyone can agree upon.
Avoid hurtful and derogatory language. Some people may think they're very funny, but 
sometimes language can be very, very painful. Try to determine what those boundaries are and 
where you 'don't want to cross those particular boundaries.
Be inclusive and treat everyone equitably. And embrace diversity, 'don't fight it.
These are very important ground rules, meetings, and team values that I think
if you hammer out and everyone can come up with an agreement on the team, I think you'll
progress very, very well through the project. Whenever I start a project, I like to really
make sure to set the expectations and to be clear at the very beginning and to prevent any ambiguity 
34 00:03:22,980 --&gt; 00:03:28,980 so I will typically go ahead and have one-on-ones with each 
individual. Preset expectations, especially with communication and then redo that again as a whole 
team just to make sure everybody understands and gives them the opportunity for Q and A as well.
Well, I mentioned that team charter document just a couple of minutes ago.
A team charter is a document that defines ground rules and norms in six key areas. So now, I'll
give you the Project Management Institute's six areas. Those six areas that you want to consider
having ground rules and norms in are, 1-team values, which we talked about a second ago.
2-Communications guidelines. What's an example of that? Perhaps for emails, if it is urgent, we 
will
put "Urgent" in the subject line, and everyone will agree to get back within 24 hours.
3-Decision making process and criteria. How are decisions going to be made?
Is there a process and how can you be inclusive in that particular process?
4-Conflict resolution process. Conflict means people have a different idea,
different thoughts, different opinions. When that occurs, how do we resolve them?
We talked just a minute ago about 5-meeting guidelines. Definitely,
that rule of 48/24 is one of my favorites.
And 6-team agreements. What do we agree to do in terms of supporting each other?

Sometimes we'll have stakeholders who say, "Yeah, yeah, I'll do it" or "I totally agree
with everything" and all of a sudden you see that they're not really participating
or they're not agreeing to your ground rules.What you need to do first is have a one-on-one
with them reset those expectations and to find out why they're not agreeing to it or
what is going on. Is there something else in the background? For example, they don't have
enough training or something like that.Find out the why, in addition to resetting
those expectations. If that doesn't work out. And you have taken the time to really
push those ground rules and make sure that they understand they have all the training.
Then you need to go to management. Sometimes you actually do need to escalate as well.


Module 3 Summary and Highlights: 
Information Sharing: Stakeholder 
Management
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:
•	The stakeholder register is a guide for critical communications which the project 
manager creates in conjunction with the project charter during the initiation phase of 
the project management lifecycle. You learned what the Project Management Institute 
(PMI) recommends as tools and techniques to identify stakeholders and gain commitment. 
You should identify stakeholders as early in the project as possible to enhance maximum 
participation and commitment.
•	The purpose of the stakeholder engagement plan is to list key stakeholders in the 
stakeholder register. We reviewed key strategies to attain desired levels of stakeholder 
engagement. The stakeholder engagement plan is a close-hold plan; all stakeholders 
are different. The project manager should analyze each stakeholder to determine their 
motivations and adapt strategies to each.
•	The importance of effectively managing stakeholders and why project managers may reduce 
levels of stakeholder commitment. 
•	The benefits of setting ground rules and norms can eliminate many issues in the long term. 
We introduced a team charter concept.
•	Methods for a project manager to maintain stakeholder support throughout the project and 
how to strategize with the team via the Tuckman Ladder model. You reviewed motivation 
theories that can help shake stakeholder engagement strategies.

Project Risk Management Overview

Welcome to "Project Risk Management Overview."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify the need for effective project risk management.
Describe the steps in the project risk management lifecycle.
List five primary reasons that lead to project failure.
And explain key project risk management roles and their responsibilities.
Risk is any event that can impact a project.
For example, miscommunication among team members might introduce a project delay.
Recent productive project management statistics reveal that over 50% of projects fail.
A prominent reason for project failure is allowing risk to manage you rather than you
managing the risk.
The project manager and team must be aware of impacts on the project.
Now, every project has a level of uncertainty.
These uncertainties can lead to five primary reasons that may cause a project to fail.
They include: failure to achieve an on-time product or service
delivery, cost overruns that negate project value,
inability to achieve project objectives developed when the project was approved,
failure to satisfy requirements as stated by customers and key stakeholders, and
delivering products or services with little or no value at project end.
The Project Management Institute, or (r) PMI, states, "an effective risk management program
can increase chances of a successful project by 90%."
PMI shares a five-step approach, or lifecycle, to manage project risk:
Plan Risk, Identify Risk, Analyze, Respond, and Control.
In this approach, the first step is
1-Plan Risk. In this step, the project manager creates a Risk Management Plan.
This plan provides an overview of how risk management will be accomplished for the project.
Note, that another video covers the Risk Management Plan in detail.
The next step is 2-Identify Risk. The project manager and team develop a "risk register."
The risk register documents all risks identified using a method called risk metalanguage.
Risk metalanguage provides a three-part structured description of a risk, which includes 
cause, risk, and effect.
Again, a different video covers risk metalanguage in more detail.
The third step in the project risk management lifecycle is 3-Analyse.
Each risk must be analysed in a qualitative and quantitative manner.
Analysis is essential as all risks do not have a similar impact potential.
After Analyse comes 4-Respond.
The project manager and team develop risk responses.
Some responses may be implemented before a risk occurs, while others may be implemented
after the fact.
Finally, 5-Control.
Risks must be continually reviewed and controlled through project end.
Remember, risk is not a one-time occurrence.
Successful project risk management depends on establishing a team.
This team should be comprised of different roles, including a project manager, risk owner,
sponsor, and subject matter expert or SME.
Let's look at responsibilities for each role.
The project manager must be part of the risk management team.
The project manager is responsible for managing project risk management program activities
including planning, implementing, monitoring, and controlling.
The risk owner is responsible for managing an identified risk.
A risk owner analyses the risk, determines risk priority, develops and manages responses,
and monitors and controls the risk.
A sponsor approves the risk management plan for the project.
A sponsor also approves, designates, and authorizes reserves.
Reserves refer to the contingency funds that may be used if a risk response requires funding.
The SME is a stakeholder who can be consulted for any technical aspects of a risk.
In this video, you learned that: Effective risk management can help with preventing
project failure.
Five reasons a project may fail include failure to meet schedule, cost overruns, inability
to achieve objectives, failure to satisfy requirements, and delivering little or no value.
The five steps in the project risk management lifecycle include Plan Risk, Identify Risk,
Analyze, Respond, and Control.
A project risk management team should include a project manager, risk owner, sponsor, and 
SME.

Risk Defined

Welcome to "Risk Defined."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe key takeaways from PMI's Uncertainty Performance Domain.
Explain risk categories.
Describe risk types.
And define the term "issue."
As discussed in another video, risk is defined as "any potential event that can impact
a project positively or negatively."
For example, every person on the project uses a computer.
There is a possibility that some computers may not have all the required software loaded.
This will limit accessibility.
This is a risk, a potential event.
PMI added the Uncertainty Performance Domain in the Project Management Body of 
Knowledge (r) (PMBOK) to address activities and functions associated with risk and uncertainty.
Here are some key takeaways.
The current business environment is filled with uncertainty.
Technical, social, political, market and economic events can impact a project.
A project manager and team must proactively identify potential events that can impact
a project and plan accordingly.
There are multiple variables in a project.
Every action you take may have an impact on different aspects of the project.
You must identify cause-and-effect variables for every aspect.
All risks are not equal.
Some risks have greater potential than others to impact the project.
Constant analysis and prioritization are key.
Conditions impacting a project will likely change.
Effective risk management is critical from project beginning to end.
Remember, effective risk management identifies BOTH positive and negative events.
And risk can impact both schedules and budget.
Closely monitor the plan, schedule, and budget reserve.
Based on their impact on the project, we can broadly categorize risks into threats and
opportunities.
A risk with a negative impact is referred to as a threat.
When a threat occurs, it can have a negative impact on scope, schedule, and budget.
The project manager and team need to identify and plan for potential threats to ensure minimal
impact on the project.
When a risk has a positive impact, it is called an "opportunity."
There may be potential events that can lead to positive impacts, such as the ability to
add product functionality, accelerate schedules, or cost savings.
Effective risk management looks for potential opportunities to improve project performance.
Risks can be divided into two types, known and unknown.
"Known risks" are risks the project management team and stakeholders have identified.
If a threat or an opportunity has been identified by the team, it will be a known risk.
"Unknown risks" are those yet to be identified.
Any unidentified threat or opportunity is an "unknown risk."
A key goal of project risk management is to identify as many risks as you can before they
occur. This includes both threats and opportunities.
The sooner you identify a risk and make it known, the sooner you can develop appropriate
responses to address it.
Managing risks is critical to the success of a project.
Risk management begins on Day 1 of the project.
Risks are identified and documented as Planning progresses and are initially identified during
the Project Charter development process.
Additional risks are identified during scope, schedule, and budget planning.
Support planning will also likely lead to additional risk identification.
Another video covers the end-to-end risk planning process and associated activities.
All identified risks must be added to a risk register.
The risk register is a document used to add and track risks.
The risk register also includes information, such as the likelihood of the risk occurring
and risk impact.
The risk register should be updated every time a risk is identified.
If a risk becomes an actual event, it is referred to as an "issue."
The project manager must keep track of issues in an issue log.
An issue log is a document containing a list of issues along with details required to track
the issue, such as issue description, current status, and priority.
Note that another video covers issue logs in detail.
In this video, you learned that: Risk is an inherent part of any project that
is impacted by many variables.
Project managers should identify positive and negative risks and prioritize how to handle
them based on their potential impact on budget and schedule.
Two categories of risk include: Threat, which has a negative impact on the
project, and Opportunity, which has a positive impact on
the project.
Two types of risk include: Known risks, which have been identified by
the project manager, and Unknown risks, which have not yet been identified.
And, if a risk becomes an actual event, it is called an issue.

Risk Metalanguage

Welcome to "Risk Metalanguage."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain the need for a risk metalanguage statement.
Identify parts of the risk metalanguage statement.
And describe parts of the risk metalanguage statement.
Documenting risks is mandatory.
The quality of the risk statement is equally important.
For example, consider the risk statement, "Weather is unpredictable."
This risk statement is ambiguous as it does not provide a clear view of why the unpredictability
is a risk or what will happen if the weather changes.
An ambiguous statement can be difficult to decipher.
This can result in a project manager taking an incorrect action to manage the risk.
Risk metalanguage is an industry best practice that helps with writing unambiguous and accurate 
risk statements.
The risk metalanguage breaks the risk statement into three parts: cause, event, and impact.
The Project Management Institute (PMI) does not define risk metalanguage by name.
However, PMI states that the initial risk entries in a Risk Register should include
risk cause and effect statements.
Part one of the risk metalanguage maps to cause.
Parts two and three constitute the effect and subsequent impact.
The metalanguage structure has three parts.
Let's understand each part in detail.
The first part of the structure is 1-"risk cause."
Risk cause is a situation or condition that exists.
"Bad weather" and "Good weather" are two examples of risk cause.
2-Event is the second part.
Event defines what can potentially occur due to the cause.
For example, bad weather could result in rain.
In this example, "rain" is the event.
Similarly, good weather may result in sunshine.
"Sunshine" is the event.
The last part of risk metalanguage is 3-impact.
Impact answers the question, "Why does the event matter?"
Using the weather example, the impact of rain may result in a delay in external work, and
schedules may slip.
The impact of sunshine, however, may allow the team to work longer and make up for any
lost time due to the rain.
Let's rewrite the statement, "Weather is unpredictable," in a way that it will
appear in the risk register.
In this video, you learned that: Ambiguous risk statements can result in confusion
and chaos.
Risk metalanguage provides a structure to develop risk statements.
Risk metalanguage breaks the risk statement into three parts:
Cause, which is a situation or condition that exists.
Event, which defines what can potentially occur due to the cause.
And impact, which provides a response to the question, "Why does the event matter?"

Demo: SWOT Analysis

Hello everyone, and welcome to a quick demonstration on a SWOT analysis.
SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
A SWOT analysis is a very commonly used risk identification tool.
Let's begin with a quick definition of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
Let's begin with strengths and opportunities.
A strength in SWOT refers to internally controlled features that are positive.
Opportunities in SWOT result from existing strengths and document external events that
may occur as a result.
Turning our attention to weaknesses and threats.
Weaknesses in SWOT refer to internally controlled factors that are negative.
And threats in SWOT result from existing weaknesses and document external events that may 
occur as a result.
Today, for this SWOT analysis demonstration, we're going to feature a process improvement
project.
A team gathered together and identified two strengths and associated opportunities and
two weaknesses and associated threats.
Let's take a look at what they identified.
The first strength that the team identified was a reliable supply chain.
Now you may be asking yourself, how is this an internal consideration?
You're the organization; you determine who is going to partner with you in the supply chain.
If the supply chain is satisfactory, you are empowered to go ahead and maintain these partnerships.
If the supply chain is not satisfactory, you are empowered to go ahead and change.
The second strength that was identified by the team was high customer satisfaction.
So, we had two strengths.
The next step was to take a look and determine: what are the external opportunities that may
result from these two strengths?
So, we take a look first of all at the reliable supply chain.
The teams determine that with this reliable supply chain, there was a high potential for
supplier willingness to adapt to any improvements and changes that were made.
The high customer satisfaction was analysed, and the team determined that based on this
high customer satisfaction, the customers may be willing to partner with us and hopefully
expedite the implementation of any improvements.
A win-win situation for the organization and the customer.
However, there were two weaknesses that were identified by the team as well.
The first weakness that was identified was there were many manual operations in the current
process, and the second was there was employee complacency.
Their employees had learned to live with a very ineffective and very inefficient process.
The next step was to evaluate the threats.
They took a look once again at many manual operations and determined that the primary
threat was limited improvement opportunities.
As a result of the manual operations, many of the improvement solutions may not be able
to be implemented.
And for employee complacency, they took a look and determined that there might be some
resistance to change.
They completed their SWOT analysis and then went to the next step.
They took their strengths and opportunities, weaknesses, and threats, and they completed
their risk register.
After they documented the information that they had attained during the SWOT analysis,
they defined the impact of each of the opportunities and impact of each of the threats.
They assigned probability and impact numbers to each opportunity and each threat and 
calculated a risk score.
This concludes our brief overview of SWOT analysis.
Hopefully, you have gained a better understanding of SWOT analysis, its purpose, and the 
methodology to go ahead and complete this analysis.
Thank you for your attention, and we look forward to seeing you in future demos.


The Risk Management Plan

Welcome to "The Risk Management Plan." After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define the purpose of a risk management plan.
And describe the different sections of a risk management plan.
A risk management plan describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed 
for the project.
The risk management plan provides instructions and a roadmap for how risk
management for a project will be conducted. After the risk management plan is approved,
it becomes part of the overall project management plan.
The risk management plan contains different sections.
These include:
1-Risk management team,
2-Definitions of probability and impact,
3-Probability and impact matrix,
4-Risk reassessment schedule,
5-Risk contingency reserves, and
6-Clarification and comments.

Let's look at each of these in detail.
The risk management plan should have details about the risk management team.
This list should includes responsibilities for different roles including,
project manager, risk owner, Subject matter experts (SME), and any other stakeholder 
involved in overall project risk management.
The risk management plan should also contain definitions for probability and impact ratings.
These ratings are used to score the project risks, which helps the project manager prioritize 
and monitor risks.
Note: PMI recommends using a simple Likert scale from 1-5.
Once definitions are complete, the project manager can determine the risk score by multiplying 
the probability score times the impact score. The higher the risk score, the more a risk
should be monitored. This table displays an example of probability and impact ratings.
Depending on the risk score, the project manager will need to take different actions.
To ensure a common structure is followed by all members of the project team, the project manager
must define the probability and impact matrix. This matrix contains the risk score
ranges along with associated actions. Here is a table displaying a sample matrix.
The project manager should also document the risk assessment schedule in the risk 
management plan.
As part of the schedule, document when project risks will be reviewed.
And include status meeting requirements, status reporting requirements, and management 
reporting requirements.
Detailed schedules should reflect in the project communications plan.
Another video covers the project communications plan in detail.
A risk management plan should contain the definition for contingency reserves
or funds required to respond to known risks. In addition, the risk management plan should
contain details about how reserves are maintained and distributed.
The risk management plan must share the amount of reserves available and the process to 
access them.
Note that in most cases, the project manager does not control contingency reserves or funds.
In addition to contingency reserves, a project should also have a management reserve.
Management reserves are funds set aside to support unknown risks, which can be caused due 
to various reasons, such as information gaps. The higher the project complexity,
the more management reserves should be set aside.
The risk management plan can also contain an optional section for clarifications and comments. 
This section can be used to provide references, policy, links, and so on that impact risk management 
planning.
The project manager can also reference a "risk breakdown structure," if available.
A risk breakdown structure is a list of potential risks that may impact projects broken out by 
category. The project manager can derive the risk breakdown structure by using the lessons 
learned on risks from other projects.
This table displays an example of the risk breakdown structure.

In this video, you learned that: A risk management plan describes
how risk management activities will be structured and performed for the project.
The risk management plan should contain the following sections:
Risk management team, which defines the risk management team and their roles.
Definitions of probability and impact, which defines probability and impact ratings to be applied 
to qualify all risks.
Probability and impact matrix, which determines the relative priority of all risks by risk score. 
Risk reassessment schedule to provide a schedule for risk reassessment and status 
analysis/reporting.
Risk contingency reserves that define reserves required to respond to risk, in addition to
how reserves are maintained and distributed.
And a clarification and comments section to
provide clarifying information, links, references, and so on as required.


Expert Viewpoints: Risk Planning

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Risk Planning.

In this video, we will hear from Project Managers discussing Risk Planning. They explain how they 
normally conduct risk planning, why risk management planning is necessary, how they plan for risk 
management, and tools and techniques that are critical to planning success. The best piece of advice 
that I can give you is three words: Make it real. Try to go ahead and share past lessons learned
where risks occurred that impacted the project negatively. In addition, try to share examples of 
opportunities that were lost. There's an old saying that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of 
cure. If you can provide concrete examples of how risk impacted a project, then chances are pretty 
good that you may be able to catch those stakeholders' attention.
Pretty easy response: Begin on day number one of the project. As you're developing the project
charter, which defines what the project is, why it's important, and who needs to be involved,
do a brainstorming session with whatever stakeholders are available. What are those
potential risks to this particular project? The first thing that you want to do is to define
those potential risks in the project charter. Next, identify risks as you plan. Identification
of risks is a very iterative process. Once you get through the project charter, you're
going to begin planning scope, then you begin planning your schedule, you'll begin planning
your budget. As you complete each major planning section, make sure that you spend a little bit of
time before you move forward and ask yourself, "What were some risks that were identified?"
and continually add those to your risk register. The first thing people need to know about risk
management planning is why it's important, how it affects the organization, how it affects the
outcome of the project, and what the implications are for them personally by not doing this or not
doing it well enough. Therefore, you need to explain why we do risk management planning.
And if it's not supported by the organization, if it's not something that's
part of the process of running a project or implementing something new, development, then
people are really not going to understand why, and they're not going to be committed to doing it.
So, I think if people know personally how it affects them if their job, for example,
is an engineering and they know that the outcome of not planning for a risk could be a failure of
the product. Then they're going to have more incentive to pay attention and do this risk
planning. So, I think you need to make it part of the organizational process. It really needs
to be part of everything that we do whenever there's a project, whenever there is a new
product implemented, then it should be done across the board, across the organization. It
should be something that is part of the standard process. If management doesn't support it, then
nobody else will. So, if you really want to get people interested in doing this, you have to have
management support. You have to have a process and people you understand why it's important
When it comes to planning risk management and how you do it, you have to have the team
involved from day one. They have to be part of that process. They have to be there when
you're just brainstorming what the risks are, right? Because if you don't, then you're going
to either have to go back later on and do a bunch of reworks, or you're going to miss it altogether.
And then the risk occurs, it's triggered, and then you have no plan in place for mitigating
that risk or responding to it. The second thing is you have to have a quantitative system for
identifying the risks, and normally you want to look for things like detectability,
severity, likelihood, right? Because we want to know how. If it's going to happen,
we don't know how bad it's going to be, and we want to know if we can detect it at all.
And the other thing is you have to be diligent about auditing these. This risk management plan
and that involves having something which you may call a control plan, which is a formal plan that
lays out all of the risks and how you respond, who's responsible, you know when we do it by
there's a couple ways to do it, but normally you want to look at those things.
And if you don't have any of that, then you're going to know that you're going to have a problem,
And also, if you if you have a system of auditing in place periodically,
you can go in and evaluate whether our risk, uh, measures are still valid. If the everything need,
to be updated, right? Because these are living documents that we should be updating regularly.
I'm going to go ahead and share three of them very briefly. Number one is a risk management plan,
and in a future interview, we're going to delve a little bit deeper into this risk management
plan. But in essence, it's an overview of how overall risk management will be conducted. Have
a plan. Plan it before you do it. Secondly, the risk register. This is a very common tool; it
is a place where you list the risks. You begin by filling out the risks that you identify during the
project charter. As you plan scope, you add risks to this risk register or list. As you do schedule
and budget planning, you add risks. By the time you've completed all of your planning, you're
probably going to have a pretty long list of risks to go ahead and manage. And the risk register is
that primary document that you use to go ahead and document those risks. Last but not least, and
again, we'll go ahead and explain this a little bit more in a future interview. There's another
tool called a risk matrix. It's a very simple visual overview of the top risks that impact
the project. You want to use this risk matrix for stakeholder and leadership presentations.
And again, we'll talk to this a little bit more, but as they say, a picture is worth 1000 words.
Appreciate the opportunity to answer these first three questions, and I'll
see you again in the next risk-focused subject matter expert interview session.

Customer & Stakeholder Interaction
This article will teach you about project managers' challenges in implementing an effective risk 
program, risk appetite, risk thresholds, and how they impact risk planning.
Challenges project managers encounter in implementing an 
effective risk program
Project managers may encounter many challenges when managing an effective risk management 
program. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) identifies the following 
challenges:
•	Uncertainty. The organization may not have a solid awareness of issues, events, paths to 
follow, or solutions to pursue. A project manager should understand the project and ensure 
there are Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) available to provide guidance.
•	Ambiguity. Risks can be unclear, and there are challenges in identifying event causes and 
determining response options. Ensure you enlist the support of risk owners and SMEs who 
are experts in their fields.
•	Complexity. Many manage programs and projects in various environments that are difficult 
to manage. The project manager and team must recognize human behaviours and 
motivation, system behaviours, and ambiguity as a team.
•	Volatility. The pace of change is rapid. A solid project risk management program is 
proactive - not reactive. It looks head and plans for change. It analyzes both current and 
future conditions.
•	Flexibility. Gather credible information and prepare for multiple outcomes. Explore various 
designs to respond to risk events. Be adaptive and resilient.
How risk appetite and risk thresholds impact risk planning
Risk appetite is "the degree of uncertainty an organization is willing to accept in anticipation 
of a reward." The project manager and team must know the organizational risk appetite and plan 
accordingly. For example, an organization may have rigid funding limits. In this case, the project 
manager must guard the budget, even at the expense of the scope and schedules. On the other hand, 
an organization may be willing to stretch budget limits to achieve a valued outcome. If this is the 
case, the project can accept more risk.
Risk thresholds are a "measure of acceptable variation around an objective that reflects the 
risk appetite of the organization or stakeholders." The Project Management Institute (PMI) is 
relatively rigid in assessing project success. For example, if a project budget is approved for 
$100,000 and the final costs are $100,001 - this is a failed project. The project manager establishes 
thresholds when budgets and/or schedules are approved. Using the budget example, if a more 
flexible threshold of plus or minus 5% had been approved, success would have been defined 
between $95,000 to $105,000. The project is a success.

Module 4 Summary and Highlights: 
Introduction to Project Risk Management
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:
•	The need for an effective project risk management lifecycle and the roles and 
responsibilities essential to project risk management success.
•	The definition of risk and uncertainty in projects. We defined known versus unknown risks 
and the difference between risks and issues. The project manager should identify both 
opportunities and threats. Threats can impact the project baseline negatively, while 
opportunities can enhance project baseline performance. Effective risk management 
requires attention to both risk categories.
•	Model risk metalanguage to document risks and how to distinguish between a cause, 
event, and impact. Risk metalanguage tells a story, is easy to understand, and allows for 
actionable responses.
•	The purpose of SWOT analysis and how a project manager can use a SWOT analysis 
to identify opportunities and threats. SWOT is a proven method to identify risk causes 
and potential events and impacts that follow.
•	The purpose and contents of a risk management plan, and you can explain traditional 
ratings for probability and impact. You can describe contingency reserves and

Respond to Risk

Welcome to "Responding to Risk."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify risk response categories.
Describe responses to threats.
Explain responses to opportunities.
And describe responses to both threats and opportunities.
Every risk should have a response strategy.
The Project Management Institute (PMI) categorizes risk responses into eight distinct strategies,
including: Three strategies to respond to threats,
Three strategies to respond to opportunities, And two strategies that can respond to either
threats or opportunities.
Every risk owner should use these strategies when creating risk responses.
The response strategy you choose is tied to risk metalanguage.
Remember, "Every risk has a cause that leads to a potential event, which leads to a potential
impact."
Strategies are dependent upon whether or not the team can control the cause of the risk.
If the cause can be controlled, certain strategies are appropriate.
If not, other strategies are required.
There are three response strategies for negative risks or threats.
These include avoid, transfer, and mitigate.
Avoid a cause that can be controlled.
For example, the project manager, risk owner, or team can easily identify and control causes,
such as: An ineffective team member,
Lack of training, Or manual processes.
Transferring a risk to a third-party is another strategy to manage threats.
This strategy can be used when the project team does not have the required expertise.
Then the third-party will be accountable to manage the risk.
Examples could be: Life insurance,
or a contract SME.
The third strategy is to Mitigate.
The project manager will use the mitigation strategy if the team feels they do not have
any control over the cause.
If a threat is identified, look at ways to reduce the probability and impact of the risk
if it occurs.
Examples of mitigation as a strategy include: Planning indoor work in the event of rain,
and Developing workarounds to reduce the impact of new regulatory guidance.
We discussed the response strategies for threats.
Next, let's look at response strategies for opportunities.
There are three recommended strategies, including exploit, share, and enhance.
Exploit, or take advantage of, the cause that can be controlled.
For example, you may be able to leverage a motivated team member or a highly trained
team to improve the probability of high productivity.
Sharing an opportunity with a third-party is another strategy.
The third-party will be accountable for partnering with the project risk management team to achieve
an opportunity.
Examples where sharing the opportunity is beneficial could be:
Combining orders to receive a discount, or Sharing expertise to achieve a mutual goal.
There may be times when the project risk management team might not have any control over 
the risk cause.
In this case, the only responses are to increase the probability of the opportunity occurring,
increase the impact of the opportunity occurring, or increase both the probability and impact
of the opportunity occurring.
Let's look at some examples for responses.
Consider the scenario where the schedule is fixed and you have no control to change it.
In this case, you should look for ways to increase the probability of an early finish.
One such strategy is to provide incentives to accelerate the schedule.
Here's another situation.
The team composition has been decided and cannot be changed.
To increase the probability of high productivity, you can provide growth opportunities to increase
motivation.
Finally, response strategies that can be used for both threats and opportunities include
acceptance and escalation.
The acceptance strategy can be used in two scenarios.
The first scenario is where the risk probability and impact are low.
In this scenario, accept that the risk might occur.
If it occurs, respond.
The second scenario is where the risk probability and impact are not clear.
In this case, the project risk management team does not have a clear acceptable response
for a risk.
If probability and impact are low, this is not a large problem.
If probability and impact are high, the project may need to be reassessed.
The escalation strategy can be used when the project manager needs to gain high-level approval
for a response, normally from the sponsor.
The escalation strategy can be used if a response is either controversial or requires additional
funding or reserves.
In this video, you learned that: The Project Management Institute (PMI) categorizes
risk responses into eight distinct strategies, including:
Three strategies to respond to threats, Three strategies to respond to opportunities,
And two strategies that can respond to either threats or opportunities.
Three response strategies for threats include Avoiding risk when the cause can be controlled,
Transferring risk to a third-party when the team does not have the expertise, and
Mitigating when the cause cannot be controlled.
Three responses for opportunities include: Exploiting or taking advantage of the opportunity,
Sharing the opportunity, and Enhancing the impact of the opportunity.
And, two response strategies for threats and opportunities include acceptance and escalation.

Demo: Risk Report
Hello everyone.
I'd like to go ahead and take a few moments to walk through another key risk management
tool called the risk report.
We're going to go ahead and take a look at the template, review the instructions to complete
the risk report, and hopefully enable you to use this tool in your everyday risk management
efforts.
We always begin by defining the project name, the project manager, and the date.
The reason for this is that the risk report is going to be unique to your particular project.
Define the project purpose, a brief description of the project, and the purpose.
Why is this project in existence?
The next category that is recommended is to list the urgent risks.
Now, what do we mean by urgent?
On your risk register, you're going to have a number of risks.
Normally an urgent risk is one that scores probability times impact greater than sixteen.
Do not include every risk.
Embed a table, as you can see in this particular illustration.
List the risk by cause, event, and impact, the response, and the risk score.
The purpose of a risk report is not to provide status of every risk; it is to provide status
of the key risks or the urgent risks.
Remember that risks come in two categories: threats and opportunities.
Part of your risk management duties is to look for opportunities as much as identify
those threats.
The same rule applies.
List your opportunities by cause-event-impact, your proposed response, and the risk score.
Any new risks that were identified since the last report, and if there were a lot of risks
that were identified, remember the rule of urgency.
If it is probability times impact sixteen or greater, then you may want to list it.
You may want to list a risk by exception if you feel that this risk is pertinent, even
if it does not score sixteen or higher.
The next category recommended in a risk report is project risk exposure, and we will go ahead
and cover that a little bit later in this demonstration.
A key aspect of the risk report is help needed.
This risk report is not for your team; it's not for you.
This risk report is provided to your sponsor and other executive stakeholders.
And it is meant to provide a quick overview of how risk management is progressing for
the project.
But a key area is help needed.
Do you need additional contingency reserves, dollars in case of risk?
Do you need response approval for some of the responses that you are proposing?
Coming back to risk exposure, the definition of risk exposure: an aggregate measure of
the potential impact of all risks at a given point in a project.
A key note: a risk score for a threat is a positive number.
Risk scores for opportunities are subtracted.
So, let's say hypothetically; we had three risks.
Two were threats, and one was an opportunity.
The threat would be four times four or a risk score of sixteen.
The opportunity, potentially 3 x 3 = 9.
But we subtract this.
Why?
Because risk exposure is how much negative risk you are being exposed to.
If there is an opportunity and opportunity can mitigate the impact of negative risks
and reduce the overall risk exposure.
We have another one which is a threat of twelve.
So, if we add these up, our risk exposure is nineteen.
To summarize this demo, here is an overview of a project.
In week one, the risk score was sixty for all of the risks.
It dropped to fifty-eight.
On week number two, fifty-four.
On week number three.
But then it began climbing again from week number four.
Risk exposure shows how the overall risk score for all risks in the project is either increasing,
decreasing, or staying the same.
This is a great tool to determine how well your risk management program is working.
If the exposure is going down, then chances are quite good that you and your team are
doing a wonderful job mitigating the potential of risks or enhancing the opportunities that
are out there.
If the risk score is going up, that is a red flag that states we may have some problems.
Maybe we want to go ahead and review this project at greater depth.
Perhaps there are some risks that we may have missed, or perhaps some responses that we
need to go ahead and implement.
This concludes a quick overview of a risk report and, in addition, a brief explanation
of the risk exposure portion of this report.
We hope that you have a better understanding of the risk report, and we do hope that this
is something, a tool that you can use as you move forward.
Thank you very much for your attention.
Have a great day, and we look forward to seeing you again in future demos.


Risk Reassessment (Review)
	
Welcome to "Risk Reassessment."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Recognize the importance of timely risk response implementation.
Describe characteristics of risk audits, including audit objectives, frequency, and process.
Explain the difference between residual and secondary risks.
And describe the contents of an "issue log."
Any risk has the potential to become an issue and impact project success.
A negative risk may impact scope, schedules, and budget.
An opportunity may be lost.
Remember, a single risk occurrence may lead to project failure.
It is essential the project risk management team recognize and implement a response in
case a risk does occur.
The risk register needs to be regularly updated to include response strategies.
Risk scores might change.
Some risks may no longer be applicable.
Such risks must be removed from the risk register.
Risk reassessment includes risk register updates, risk audits, documenting secondary and 
residual risks, and managing issues logs.
Next, let's look at risk audits.
Risk audits are an integral part of overall project risk management.
Here are the objectives of a risk audit.
Review the overall project risk monitoring process and determine the overall effectiveness
of the risk management plan.
Review the effectiveness of risk response strategies to make adjustments as required
for the remaining project.
Also, determine if risk responses were appropriate or if further action is required.
Remember, always document the audit and relevant conclusions.
Risk audits should be scheduled at an appropriate frequency based on the needs of the project.
Project scope is a key factor that helps in deciding the frequency and quantity of audits.
Medium and large projects may require more frequent risk audits.
Smaller projects may have a risk audit only at the end of all work.
Risk audit frequency and processes are defined in the risk management plan.
Let's briefly look at the risk audit process.
A risk audit is triggered based on the frequency specified in the risk management plan.
During the audit, the overall effectiveness of risk management monitoring is evaluated.
If any changes are identified, the project risk management team will make the required
changes.
The risk audit also evaluates risk response effectiveness.
The risk register is updated if the response was adequate and results are documented in
lessons learned.
If a risk response was not adequate, residual risks are identified and documented in the
risk register for further action.
Let's understand residual risks in more detail.
When a risk occurs, a response is initiated.
In some cases, the response is adequate.
However, in some cases, the risk may still be present in an altered state.
This is referred to as a residual risk.
Here is an example.
Consider this scenario.
The primary risk, "Snowfall resulted in limited parking," occurred.
The identified response, "Use a commercial company to plow the parking lot and remove
the snow," was implemented.
Later, an ice coating was found in the parking lot under the snow.
This is a residual risk.
The ice became an issue when the snow cover was removed.
The risk owner needs to identify and document the new residual risk and implement the response
to de-ice the parking lot.
Residual risks are added to the risk register when discovered.
The project risk management team may also encounter secondary risks.
Many high-probability and impact risks require multiple risk response options.
In some cases, a primary and fallback response is generated.
If the primary response does not yield desired results, the fallback response is initiated.
There may be times when a primary or fallback response generates a new risk.
This is referred to as a secondary risk.
Here is an example.
The primary risk response is to increase safety inventory levels to mitigate the risk of material
shortages.
However, there is a secondary risk.
If the team increases safety stock levels, they may not have adequate storage space.
The team's response is to lease adequate storage space.
However, this response has cost impacts.
In this situation, check if the cost outweighs the benefits of increasing safety stock.
Another way to look at the risk might be to check if the costs of leasing more storage
space outweigh the risks of project delays due to material shortages.
If a secondary risk presents greater challenges than the primary risk, then the primary risk
response should be adjusted.
Finally, let's look issues and issue logs.
An issue is defined as a risk that occurred.
The project team must identify issues as soon as possible and implement planned risk responses.
Any residual risks should also be documented.
A best practice is to create an issue log with all relevant information about the issue
and resolution.
An example of headings that might be captured in an issue log are displayed.
The contents of an issue log should include Accurate and actionable description of the
issue.
The issue log should also include issue priority, such as High, Moderate, or Low.
Remember, all issues are not equal.
You can also include the issue category, such as, operations and finance.
Ensure the issue log captures the details about the issue reporter and issue resolver.
This will help establish the required communication to efficiently resolve the issue.
Issue status is another important information that you must capture.
Examples of issue status include active, deferred, or resolved.
Finally, the issue log must contain the date of issue resolution, which will be documented
after the issue is successfully resolved.
Note that PMI does not provide any recommendations on the contents of an issue log.
In this video, you learned that: Timely response to a risk is important as
a single risk occurrence may lead to project failure
Risk audits help determine the effectiveness of the risk management plan and response 
strategy.
Frequency of risk audits will vary based on project scope.
Risk audits may result in updating the risk management plan and residual risks.
A residual risk is identified when a response uncovers an altered risk state.
A secondary risk is identified when a fallback response is implemented.
An issue log should contain all relevant information about the issue and resolution.

Demo: Risk Matrix

Hello everyone.
Today I would like to go ahead and do a brief demonstration on a tool and technique that
is used quite often in project risk management.
This tool is called a risk matrix.
The primary tool that is used to identify and document risks by the project team is
the risk register.
However, a risk register often has more information than is needed by all of the project 
stakeholders.
There may be times when you need to provide risk status to perhaps the sponsor or other
key stakeholders.
When that is the case, the risk matrix is your best choice.
A risk matrix is meant to be a visual tool.
A risk matrix also provides very quick status.
The status is meant to be impactful, and in addition, by using this risk matrix, you can
oftentimes share your proposed responses and gain input on the validity of those responses
as well.
So, let's go ahead and share how a project manager and team would fill out or complete
a risk matrix.
We have a project called the Company Picnic, and two risks were previously identified.
Remember, a risk is documented using cause, event, and impact nomenclature.
It's called risk metalanguage.
A risk should tell a story.
So, our first risk or story, if you will, is: there is the potential for insects to
come and bite our participants, and if they bite our participants, that could result in
illness and discomfort.
So, we develop a response.
Our response is: we're going to go ahead and provide repellant to all of our participants.
The next thing we do is we go back to our risk register and we review the probability
and impact ratings.
In this particular case, you'll notice on the grid we have probability three and impact
three.
We put down R1, which stands for risk one, and now we have a compelling visual of where
risk number one fits on the impact and probability scale.
Our next risk that we identified was: there is a potential for bad weather.
And bad weather could bring with it rain.
And if we do have rain, we may have to reduce our events.
So, what is a applicable response?
Let's go ahead and create a few tents so that people can take cover if it rains and still
enjoy the picnic.
We go back to our risk register, and we see that bad weather was a probability of two
and an impact of four, so we go to our risk matrix grid and we put down risk number two.
Let's go ahead and identify a third risk.
Unfortunately, we have a lot of illness that is going around our particular community,
and if the illness occurs, we may end up with unfortunately reduced participation.
And what is the impact of reduced participation?
That would be reduced team interaction.
So, what can we do as a response to this?
What we may want to do is we may want to allow virtual participation.
Allow those who may be ill or unable to attend the event to at least look in, hear the keynote
speakers, and see some of the fun that the team is having at the picnic.
Remember that risk comes in two categories.
Risks can be negative, or threats, or positive, or opportunities.
And part of good effective risk management is looking for opportunities as well.
But before we move forward, we still have one task.
We take a look at this new risk, and we determine what is the probability and what is the impact.
So, our team gets together, and they determined that the probability is probably three, but
the impact is going to be five.
So, in this particular case, we put down our three.
And now we have a risk that's in the red area, and normally risks that are coated red on
the risk matrix get a lot of attention from the individuals who are receiving the status
update.
Let's take a look at a second type of risk, the opportunity.
We already have one in place.
The cause is good weather, and if we have good weather, we may have an abundance of
sunshine, and if we have an abundance of sunshine, maybe we can plan some more events.
So, what is the response?
Well, if we do achieve this good weather and sunshine, let's add a 1K trail walk.
If it rains, we will not have that trail walk.
But if it does, this is just another event that will be fun and help the team to come
together.
We identified a second opportunity.
The CEO is supporting this project, and as a result of this wonderful level of CEO support,
we can potentially expect some increased funding.
And what is the impact of increased funding?
Well, we can increase the benefits to the team.
So, what would be a response to ensure that we increase these team benefits?
What we can do is say: why don't we open this picnic up for family members as well?
Now we go to our probability and impact for this particular risk, we determine that the
probability is four and the impact is four, and we put down R2 in the grid.
Notice that this is now in a green area.
What does this mean?
It means that this is a high-probability, high-impact risk.
And if we are able to achieve this response by inviting family members, we're going to
benefit really greatly if we're able to go ahead and achieve this particular opportunity.
This ends my overview of the risk matrix.
Hopefully, this was helpful to you to gain a greater understanding of this powerful risk
management tool, and I look forward to seeing you in future demos.


Module 5 Summary and Highlights: Respond 
and Monitor Risk
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know:
•	The different response types to consider when planning for risk include response to threats 
such as avoid, transfer, and mitigate. This also includes responding to exploiting, 
sharing, and enhancing opportunities. You also learned how to respond to threats and 
opportunities, such as acceptance and escalation. Remember to think through your risk 
responses and develop the appropriate strategy to meet the risk response need.
•	Tips from a Subject Matter Expert (SME) panel on developing a solid risk response and how 
to identify risk triggers. Remember the guidance the SMEs shared: risk triggers and 
responses are critical to ensure the project is not derailed by risk.
•	The importance and contents of a risk report. Use the risk report to your advantage, as it 
is a great way to communicate risk status, maintain levels of stakeholder support, and solicit 
help to address the needs and issues stemming from risks.
•	Common risk management tools to include in document reviews include brain storming, 
brainwriting, the Delphi Technique, interviewing, root cause analysis, checklist 
analysis, assumption analysis, and lessons learned. You also learned the value of using a 
risk matrix to share risk status with key stakeholders.
•	The importance of timely risk response implementation, identifying the purse and 
outputs of a risk audit, and explaining the difference between secondary and residual risks. 
Risk is not a one-time activity. Risk exposure on a project will change as the project 
continues through closure. Use every method you can to maintain the lowest risk exposure 
possible.
•	The importance of ensuring that the project manager accomplishes risk reassessments 
promptly and some critical success factors to remember when reassessing risks. Project risk 
management begins at the start of a project and continues through closure. One risk the 
project manager does not manage well can lead to failure.

Key Takeaways
Effective information sharing and risk management along with a good understanding of the project 
lifecycle are critical to a project manager's success.
The key takeaways from this course include:
•	The different types of project lifecycles include predictive and adaptive methods.
•	The Project Management Institute (PMI) describes a total of 49 crucial processes within 
each of the five phases or process groups in a predictive lifecycle.
•	The project manager's roles and responsibilities during the project management lifecycle's 
encompass initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing phases.
•	Development of the project charter and a stakeholder register occurs during the initiating 
phase, and the project manager presents these documents to a project sponsor for approval.
•	In the project planning phase, the project manager develops a comprehensive project 
management plan and presents it to a sponsor for approval. Then the project manager 
schedules a kick-off meeting and gains stakeholder acceptance of the plan.
•	The development of the project deliverables occurs during the executing phase. The skills a 
project manager must have for a successful execution phase are critical.
•	The project manager verifies that completed deliverables meet project management plan 
specifications during the monitoring and controlling phase. The project team presents the 
deliverables to a customer for acceptance.
•	In the project closing phase, the project manager ensures all deliverables meet 
specifications, attains final customer acceptance, and transitions the final product or service 
to the customer. The project manager also presents a final report during this phase, and the 
project team conducts and shares lessons learned.
•	The basic communications model stresses the importance of ensuring that the project team 
receives messages as intended and introduces the concept of communication blockers, which 
are factors that can obstruct effective communication. It is crucial to identify these blockers 
before they impact the team. The Project Management Institute (PMI) also identifies 
technology factors the project manager should analyze and plan for, as these factors can 
affect communications. Finally, the project manager should consider different 
communication needs, such as pull, push, and interactive communications, when planning 
for effective communication in each project.
•	Communications planning emphasizes the significance of effective communications in 
achieving project success. You now know the three-step approach to managing 
communications and reviewing communications management planning techniques. PMI 
states that communications are 90% the project manager's responsibility and should be a 
central focal point as you plan and execute a project. Every project should have a 
communications management plan, as a lack of communications planning will likely result 
in random and ineffective communications. The communications management plan should 
contain key communication activities crucial for project success.
•	How to implement a communications management plan. You now know the essential 
communication methods, challenges, and skills a project manager should possess. PMI 
states communication is the most difficult interpersonal skill to perfect, so you should hone 
your skills whenever possible.
•	The key tools and techniques essential to effective communication include active listening, 
conflict management, and how political awareness is vital when sharing information.
•	Communications monitoring responsibilities include effective meeting management 
techniques, best practices in virtual communications, and how the PMI Code of Ethics 
impacts effective communications.
•	The stakeholder register is a guide for critical communications which the project manager 
creates in conjunction with the project charter during the initiation phase of the project 
management lifecycle. You learned what PMI recommends as tools and techniques to 
identify stakeholders and gain commitment. You should identify stakeholders as early in the 
project as possible to enhance maximum participation and commitment.
•	The purpose of the stakeholder engagement plan is to list key stakeholders in the stakeholder 
register in terms of their current and desired levels of commitment. We reviewed key 
strategies to attain desired levels of stakeholder engagement. The stakeholder engagement 
plan is a close-hold plan; all stakeholders are different. The project manager should analyse 
each stakeholder to determine their motivations and adapt strategies to each.
•	The importance of effectively managing stakeholders and how project managers may 
increase or reduce levels of stakeholder commitment was shared.
•	The benefits of setting ground rules and norms eliminate many issues in the long term. We 
introduced a team charter concept.
•	Methods for a project manager to maintain stakeholder support throughout the project and 
how to strategise with the team via the Tuckman Ladder model. You reviewed motivation 
theories that can help shape stakeholder engagement strategies.
•	The need for an effective project risk management lifecycle and the roles and 
responsibilities essential to project risk management success were highlighted.
•	The definition of risk and uncertainty in projects. We defined known versus unknown risks 
and the difference between risks and issues. The project manager should identify both 
opportunities and threats. Threats can impact the project baseline negatively, while 
opportunities can enhance project baseline performance. Effective risk management requires 
attention to both risk categories.
•	Modelled risk metalanguage to document risks and how to distinguish between a cause, 
event, and impact. Risk metalanguage tells a story, is easy to understand, and allows for 
actionable responses.
•	The purpose of SWOT analysis and how a project manager can use a SWOT analysis to 
identify opportunities and threats. SWOT is a proven method to identify risk causes and 
potential events and impacts that follow.
•	The purpose and contents of a risk management plan are where you define ratings for 
probability and impact and distinguish between urgent and non-urgent risks. You also 
describe contingency reserves and management reserves.
•	The risk register is the primary tool project managers use to identify and manage risks by 
analysing each risk and understanding how it impacts the project.
•	The different response types to consider when planning for risk include response to threats 
such as avoid, transfer, and mitigate. This also includes responding to exploiting, sharing, 
and enhancing opportunities. You also learned how to respond to threats and opportunities, 
such as acceptance and escalation. Remember to think through your risk responses and 
develop the appropriate strategy to meet the risk response need.
•	Risk triggers and responses are critical to ensure the project is not derailed by risk.
•	Use the risk report to your advantage, as it is a great way to communicate risk status, 
maintain levels of stakeholder support, and solicit help to address the needs and issues 
stemming from risks.
•	Common risk management tools to use when documenting reviews include brain storming, 
brainwriting, the Delphi Technique, interviewing, root cause analysis, checklist analysis, 
assumption analysis, and lessons learned. You also learned the value of using a risk matrix to 
share risk status with key stakeholders.
•	Risk is not a one-time activity. Risk exposure on a project will change as the project 
continues through closure. Use every method you can to maintain the lowest risk exposure 
possible.
•	Project risk management begins at the start of a project and continues through closure. One 
risk the project manager does not manage well can lead to failure.

Put Your People First

Welcome to "Put Your People First."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Discuss ways to foster a healthy environment for team members.
And explain effects of empowering team members.
As important as schedules, deliverables, and tools to manage the project are to success,
the people that do the work of the project matter most. Ensuring that the people involved in the
project are motivated and clearly understand what they're working on sets a project up for 
success.
Project managers, many times, don't directly manage the people or even
the work that is being done. But they can greatly impact morale
and productivity by serving the team with clear schedules, goals, and deliverables.
One way project managers can help a team to function well is to ensure people are
working on tasks that match or slightly exceed their skillset and disposition. For example,
software developers shouldn't be expected to write marketing copy. Project managers
can work with people managers to ensure there is proper alignment for workers and tasks by:
Clearly defining each team member's tasks
and responsibilities and ensuring they understand their role in the project.
Assigning tasks to team members based on their skills, experience,
and abilities. This maximizes the use of the team's strengths.
Regularly monitoring the progress of each team member and the project as a whole.
This helps identify areas where team members may need additional
support or where tasks may need to be reallocated.
Providing team members with training and development opportunities to enhance
their skills and abilities. This helps to develop a highly skilled and motivated team.
Another way project managers can focus on people is by empowering them to keep
the project moving forward. Empowerment is the process of giving team members the 
authority, resources, and support they need to complete their tasks effectively and achieve 
their project goals. It involves creating an environment where team members feel
valued and appreciated and are encouraged to take ownership of their tasks and use
their skills, experience, and creativity to contribute to the project's success.
Project managers can empower their team by matching tasks to team members based on their
skills, experience, and abilities. Matching skill sets with the appropriate team members 
empowers them to complete each task to the highest standard and maximizes the team's 
strengths.
Project managers also empower their teams by creating a positive and
supportive work environment where team members feel valued and appreciated.
Encouraging open and regular communication also empowers
team members and stakeholders. Open communication can help identify issues
or concerns and allow for effective collaboration and problem-solving.
When team members feel empowered, they are more likely to be motivated and committed
to the project. This can lead to higher levels of productivity and a more positive work environment.
Empowerment can help build morale and motivation and improve team dynamics.
Empowering team members invites new ideas and innovative solutions to the
project and can lead to improved ways of working.
By empowering team members to take ownership of their tasks, they are more likely to identify
and solve problems as they arise, which can help to keep the project on track.
Similarly, an empowered team is one that knows they can work on any open
task on which they are skilled to keep the project moving forward.
This can reduce friction and delays, and creates a more collaborative environment.
Since many people spend a good portion of their day working on projects,
project managers should help people enjoy what they're doing.
Promoting open communication and fostering a sense of teamwork creates a positive and
supportive work environment. This can help build morale and motivation and improve team 
dynamics.
Recognize and reward the efforts and successes of team members. This can help to build 
motivation and also improve team morale.
Know which things are important and urgent and which aren't. Not everything requires
urgent language, and some things don't need to be addressed. Knowing how to weigh
things will help keep the important things important, build trust, and reduce stress.
Encourage team members to maintain a healthy work-life balance. This can help reduce stress 
and burnout and improve overall job satisfaction.
As a project manager, your primary focus should be on timelines, deliverables, and ensuring 
stakeholders are getting what they need.
People are the key to success, and, as a project manager, you play a crucial role in that 
success.

In this video, you learned that:
Ways to foster a healthy environment for team members include:
Empowering team members
Builds morale
Improves team dynamics
Invites innovation
Reduces friction
Prevents delays

Maximizing team strengths by serving the team with clear schedules, goals, and deliverables.
Regularly monitoring the progress of each team member and the project as a whole to identify 
areas where team members may need additional support or where tasks may need to be 
reallocated.
Providing team members with training and development opportunities to enhance their skills 
and abilities.
Empowering team members to keep the project moving forward by giving team members the 
authority, resources, and support they need to complete their tasks effectively and achieve 
their project goals. This can be achieved by:
-Creating an environment where team members feel valued and appreciated and are 
encouraged to take ownership of their tasks and use their skills, experience, and creativity to 
contribute to the project's success.
- Matching tasks to team members based on their skills, experience, and abilities.
-Matching skill sets with the appropriate team members empowers them to complete each 
task to the highest standard and maximizes the team's strengths.
- Creating a positive and supportive work environment where team members feel valued and 
appreciated by encouraging open and regular communication also empowers team members 
and stakeholders. Open communication can help identify issues or concerns and allow for 
effective collaboration and problem-solving. This can reduce friction and delays, and creates a 
more collaborative environment.
- Promoting open communication and fostering a sense of teamwork creates a positive and 
supportive work environment. This can help build morale and motivation and improve team 
dynamics.
- Recognize and reward the efforts and successes of team members. This can help to build 
motivation and also improve team morale.
- Encourage team members to maintain a healthy work-life balance. This can help reduce 
stress and burnout and improve overall job satisfaction.

Communicating Clear Project Objectives

Welcome to "Communicating Clear Project Objectives."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
explain the importance of project objectives,
discuss the project manager's responsibilities regarding the project objectives, and
explain how project objectives prevent scope creep.
Project managers are generally responsible for clearly communicating and often setting 
project objectives. These objectives, as a foundational element of any project, are the "north 
star."
Project objectives are specific, measurable, and time-bound outcomes that a project team 
works towards achieving. Objectives define what the project aims to accomplish and provide 
a clear direction for the project team. They are typically set at the beginning of the project during
the planning phase and are critical to guide decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.
Part of the project manager's responsibility in leading the team is communicating clear,
actionable project objectives early and often.
If a company is running a marketing campaign project for a new product, some of its project 
objectives might include:
-Increase brand awareness by boosting website traffic by 50% month-over-month
for three months before the product launches.
-Attract new customers by establishing partnerships with 10 micro-influencers and co-develop 3 
sharable assets.
-Reach and maintain a 3% conversion rate for three months after launch by A/B testing the 
product's marketing messaging.
A project manager can document and communicate project objectives in the project charter 
or the project scope statement. These documents outline what work will be done for the project 
and act as a tool to help project managers, project teams, and project stakeholders align on project 
objectives. Also, by formally documenting and communicating project objectives in a project 
charter or project scope statement, project managers set clear expectations for the team and 
protect against under or over-delivering.
A project manager should also communicate the project objectives during the project kick-off
meeting. During a project kick-off meeting, all relevant stakeholders, such as the project sponsor 
and project team, gather to discuss the objectives, deliverables, risks, and roles.
This meeting is the perfect time for a project manager to communicate project objectives because 
the meeting sets the tone for the project, ensures that all stakeholders are aligned, and creates 
an opportunity for high-level stakeholders to reinforce the importance of achieving the project 
objectives.
During the life of the project, a project manager should communicate the project objectives 
regularly to continue to keep all stakeholders aligned.
Project managers can do this during daily stand-ups or weekly status meetings by tying the work 
that has been done, is in progress, or that is yet to be completed to one or more of the project 
objectives.
They can also include the project objectives in weekly reporting dashboards or documents.
Communicating project objectives clearly is crucial to ensuring that everyone involved in the 
project understands what they are working towards. Whether using verbal or written 
communication, there are some ways to ensure that project objectives are communicated clearly. 
When communicating objectives, you should:
-use clear and concise language to explain the project objectives, avoid using technical jargon 
or complex language that may confuse stakeholders
-adjust the communication of project objectives depending on the audience.
Different stakeholders may have different levels of knowledge and interest in the project, so it is 
important to tailor the message to meet their needs.
-use visual aids, such as graphs, diagrams, and charts, that can help clarify the objectives and 
make them more memorable.
-help stakeholders understand how the team is going to measure the objectives.
-Finally, encourage the questions and feedback from the audience to ensure
that they understand the project objectives. Answering questions and addressing concerns can 
help to clarify any confusion or misunderstandings.
Project managers may have the responsibility of writing the project objectives. Since project 
objectives are so important to the lifecycle of the project, there are a few characteristics that project 
managers must keep in mind when developing them:
-Project objectives should be clear and unambiguous, defining exactly what the project aims 
to achieve.
-They should be quantifiable so that progress towards achieving them can be tracked and 
measured.
-And they should be realistic and attainable, given the project's constraints and available 
resources.
It is also important for project managers to remember that what is left out of project objectives is 
as important as what is put in. Project managers may find it difficult to say no, especially to key 
stakeholders. But learning to say no helps prevent scope creep and reduces the risk of 
overworked teams.
Scope creep is when project objectives, requirements, and tasks expand throughout the life of 
the project, but budget and resource constraints stay the same. A small amount of scope creep 
is generally understandable, but eventually, scope creep can lead to missed deadlines and 
increased expenses.
Saying no as a project manager can be challenging, but it is an important skill to have to 
maintain control over the project scope and ensure that the project remains on track. Here are some 
tips on how to say no as a project manager:
-When saying no, be clear and firm in your response. Use a confident and assertive tone
to communicate that you are not willing to accept a request that is outside of the project 
scope.
-Provide an explanation for why the request cannot be accommodated, including risks and 
constraints the team is working within.
When saying no, it's important to keep the big picture in mind.
-Explain how the request may impact the project timeline, budget, or overall success.
Saying no doesn't have to be confrontational.
-Be collaborative in your response and show that you are willing to work with stakeholders to 
find a solution that meets everyone's needs. Offer alternatives that may help to address the 
underlying need or concern.
Finally, document the decision. It's important to document the decision to say no and why in 
case questions or challenges arise in the future.

In this video, you learned that:
-Project objectives provide direction of the project
-Project managers should communicate clear, actionable project objectives early and often
-Document project objectives in the project charter and communicate them during the project 
kick-off meeting
-Effectively communicate project objectives by using clear and concise language
-Tailor their message and delivery to their audience, and encourage questions and feedback
-Saying no as a project manager can be challenging, but it is an important skill to have in 
order to
maintain control over the project scope and ensure that the project remains on track.
Servant Leadership

Participating in the Work

Welcome to "Participating in the Work."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
-Define servant leadership.
-Discuss the benefits of "participating in the work" as a servant leader.
-And identify best practices that help "participating in the work" as a servant leader.

Project managers, or PMs, who adopt a servant leader approach can create an environment 
more conducive to successful project outcomes. Their teams often feel empowered, are more 
collaborative, and have high morale, which sets the stage for successful projects.
Robert K. Greenleaf, credited with popularizing the concept of servant leadership, says servant
leadership is "a philosophy and set of practices that enriches the lives of individuals, builds 
better organizations, and ultimately creates a more just and caring world."
But how do project managers put servant leadership into practice?
The most effective PMs can set schedules, learn appropriate project vocabulary, and 
understand nuances of project details.
Participating in the team's work and collaborating with them can help you to learn these skills.
When project managers participate in the work that their teams are doing, they better understand the 
tasks involved in the project and the challenges that team members may face. This helps project
managers make decisions and provide more effective guidance and support to team members.
By participating in their teams' work, project managers demonstrate their willingness to get
their hands dirty and work alongside their team members. Their actions build trust and 
rapport and create a camaraderie that can improve team dynamics and morale.
While participating in the work, project managers can also observe the processes and procedures 
in action and identify areas for improvement. Then project managers can streamline workflows, 
eliminate inefficiencies, and optimize project outcomes.
Finally, when project managers participate in their teams' work, they lead by example, 
demonstrating the behaviours and attitudes they expect from their team members.
This creates a culture of collaboration, accountability, and continuous improvement.
As a project manager, you and your team may already have full schedules, which may make 
participating in the work seem difficult. Some strategies that can help make participating in the 
work easier include:
-Find thirty minutes to an hour in your calendar and schedule time to work with the team.
You can work on part of the project independently. Or, it may be time you already have scheduled 
with a team member where you can co-work on the part of the project.
-Communicate your intentions and explain why you are participating in the work before you 
jump in. This will help team members understand your perspective and avoid confusion or 
misunderstandings.
While it is important to participate in the work, it is also important to set clear boundaries and 
avoid micromanaging. Make it clear that you are there to support and assist but that you trust your 
team members to do their jobs and make their own decisions.
-Be open to learning and trying new things when participating in the work. Your team 
members may have different perspectives or approaches that can help you improve your skills and 
knowledge.
By participating in the work as a project manager, you can build stronger relationships with your 
team members, better understand the project, and model the behaviours and attitudes you 
expect from your team.

In this video, you learned that:
-Servant leadership emphasizes serving the team by focusing on their needs while also 
empowering and supporting them to reach their full potential.
-Participating in team member's work can help stay connected to the project, build 
relationships with team members, and identify opportunities for improvement that can 
enhance project outcomes.
-And project managers can participate in the work by budgeting their time for work, 
communicating their intentions, setting boundaries, and being open to learning.

Effective Conversations

Welcome to "Effective Conversations"
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe methods for having effective conversations.
Explain key communication skills to effectively manage a program.
And describe communication techniques and the technologies you can use to implement
them.
When managing a project, you will have ongoing conversations with the team and stakeholders.
Specifically, there are seven conversational areas you'll have regularly.
1-Plan the project with the team, stakeholders, and sponsors to define the scope, goals, and
timeline of the project.
2-Discuss resource allocation with the team to identify required resources (human, financial,
and material) and ensure their availability.
3-Talk about project risks with the team and stakeholders to identify potential risks,
assess their impact, and develop contingency plans.
4-Work with the team to track the project's progress, identify any deviations from the
plan, and adjust the plan as necessary.
5-Talk regularly with stakeholders to manage expectations, address concerns, and ensure
their engagement and support throughout the project.
6-Have planned and ongoing conversations with the teams, stakeholders, and sponsors to 
ensure regular, transparent, and effective communication about the project.
7-Throughout the project, talk with the team to assess their performance, identify areas
for improvement, and provide feedback
By having effective conversations, you can discover potential risks before they become
issues.
Managing resources can be challenging on any project.
Talking with your key stakeholders can help you determine the resources they have available
and the capacity they will have for the project.
Many times, projects overlap.
When teams use the same people to work on multiple projects, workloads can become overbearing.
Discussing this with other PMs can help prevent burnout.
Project managers can help prevent issues that may block progress on the project both before
the project starts and during production.
By clarifying expectations and identifying risks early, stakeholders will know what the
project will entail.
During the project, the PM will help resolve conflicts and maintain transparency on all
aspects of the project.
These help keep the project running smoothly.
These types of conversations will help you understand what stakeholders may be concerned
about.
Creating an environment of trust and transparency will help stakeholders voice their concerns
before and during the project.
Project managers also get to share in and promote success stories.
Effective conversations help people find the success in a project, and project managers
get to amplify those success stories across the team.
Amplifying success is self-perpetuating and can have a positive effect on a project.
Planning is essential to have effective conversations.
While it may seem odd to plan for an activity we do on a regular basis, planning will help
you get the most out of your conversations.
Before you start a conversation, think about what you want to achieve from it.
This will help you focus the conversation and keep it on track.
Prepare a clear and concise agenda for the conversation.
This will ensure that all the important topics are covered and that everyone has a shared
understanding of what will be discussed.
Include the topics you want to discuss and what data or information you need from the
conversation, and be sure to address any assumptions you have about the topics.
Consider the type of conversation you are having and choose an appropriate mode for
the type of conversation you are having.
For example, face-to-face, synchronous conversations may be more effective for sensitive or 
complex topics, while email or chat may be more appropriate for routine updates.
Encourage all participants to effectively listen to one another and engage in a two-way
dialogue.
This will help build trust and foster a positive and productive environment.
Conflicts are inevitable in any project, but as a project manager, you should be prepared
to handle them effectively.
Encourage open and honest communication, listen to both sides of the argument, and work towards
finding a mutually acceptable solution.
After the conversation, make sure to follow up on any action items or decisions that were
made.
This will help keep everyone accountable and ensure that the conversation remains productive.
Project managers should continually remind the team of the importance of having effective
conversations early in the project that continue through the project's end.
Effective conversations at the beginning of a project help clarify expectations and ensure
everyone is on the same page.
This includes defining project goals, expectations for team members, and the roles and 
responsibilities of each stakeholder.
Through effective communication, project managers can build trust with their team members and
stakeholders.
This helps to foster a positive and productive working environment, which is essential for
the success of a project.
Conversations throughout the project allow project managers to identify and resolve any
issues that may arise.
This includes addressing any roadblocks or challenges and finding ways to overcome them.
Effective communication helps keep everyone informed about the progress of the project,
changes in scope, and any other important updates.
This helps to maintain transparency and keep everyone aligned on the project's objectives.
By engaging in open and honest conversations, project managers can gather valuable insights
and feedback from their team members and stakeholders.
This helps to improve decision-making and ultimately leads to better project outcomes.

In this video, you learned that:
During every project, you may have key conversations about project planning, resource 
allocation,
risk management, progress monitoring, stakeholder management, communications, and 
performance evaluation.
Planning is essential to have effective conversations, as it will help you get the most out of 
your
conversations.
Effective conversations are important for the entire team, and project managers should
continually remind the team of their importance from the beginning of the project until the
end


Project Management Communications Skills

Welcome to "Project Management Communications Skills."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe why effective communication is important for project managers,
Identify key communication skills essential to the success of project managers,
And explain best practices for different types of communication
Communication skills are essential for project managers because they are responsible for
ensuring that they inform and engage all stakeholders throughout the project.
Effective communication enables project managers to build trust, resolve conflicts, provide
clear direction, and keep everyone aligned during the lifecycle of a project.
Poor communication can lead to misunderstandings, delays, and even project failure.
Hence, strong communication skills are crucial for project managers to be successful in their
role.
Communication includes more than just the ability to have a conversation.
Some key communication skills that project managers should have include:
Active listening, Oral communication , Written communication, Interpersonal communication
And Presentations.
Active listening is a communication technique that involves giving your full attention to the 
speaker, avoiding distractions and interruptions, and using verbal and non-verbal cues to 
show that you are engaged in the conversation.
Active listening is important because it helps project managers understand their stakeholders'
perspectives, needs, and concerns, including team members and clients.
By actively listening, project managers can build trust, resolve conflicts, identify potential
problems early on, and make informed decisions in the project's best interest.
Some ways that project managers can practice active listening include restating what the
speaker has said, listening to understand, and asking open-ended questions to show you
are interested in the conversation.
Oral communication is the use of spoken language to convey information, ideas, and opinions.
This form of communication is direct, immediate, and personal.
Project managers use oral communication in various settings, including one-on-one conversations,
meetings, and presentations.
Oral communication is crucial for project managers because it allows them to quickly
and effectively convey information and ideas and respond to questions and concerns in real
time.
Oral communication is particularly important for project managers because it allows them
to build relationships, motivate team members, and negotiate with stakeholders.
Additionally, oral communication can help project managers clarify complex concepts
and provide context for written or visual communications.
For effective oral communication, project managers should use clear and concise language,
adapt their communication styles based on the audience, and adjust their tone so that
it is appropriate for the conversation.
Written communication is the use of written language to document information, provide 
instructions, and to communicate with people who are not in the same physical location.
Examples of written communication in a project management context include emails, direct
messaging, reports, and presentations.
Written communication is important for project managers because it provides a record of 
information
and decisions and allows for clear and consistent communication with stakeholders who may not
be available for oral communication.
Written communication can also help project managers clarify complex concepts, (86present
data and information, and document project processes and decisions.
Effective written communication skills are essential for project managers to ensure they
are efficiently sharing accurate information and to promote transparency and accountability
in project management.
To communicate effectively through written communication, project managers should write
for clarity, be consistent in formatting and terminology, tailor their writing style for
the audience, and include graphics and visuals to communicate data.
Interpersonal communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, and emotions
between two or more people.
Interpersonal communication can be oral or written but is used to motivate, negotiate,
and facilitate collaboration.
Strong interpersonal communication skills allow project managers to understand the perspectives
and needs of their stakeholders and to communicate effectively to ensure that everyone is aligned
with the project goals.
Interpersonal communication also helps project managers to gain the trust and cooperation
of their stakeholders, manage and resolve conflicts, as well as negotiate and make decisions
which is essential for successful project outcomes.
Effective interpersonal communication involves practicing active listening skills, employing
empathy, use appropriate body language, and reinforcing messages with non-verbal cues.

Presentation skills are the ability to effectively communicate information, ideas, and opinions
through presentations, such as speeches, slide presentations, and workshops.
This form of communication requires the use of active listening, oral, written, and interpersonal
communication to engage an audience and convey complex information clearly and concisely.
Project managers with strong presentation skills can effectively communicate important
project information, such as goals, progress, and outcomes, to stakeholders.
They can also engage and motivate their audience and clarify complex concepts.
This allows them to secure buy-in and support from stakeholders and to build trust and credibility.
Effective presentations include employing best practices from other types of communication.
For presentations, it is also highly important to use visuals to effectively communicate
key points to your audience.
Jorge is a program manager at a large tech company, and his team just completed part
of their program and launched a brand-new product.
Jorge's manager asked him to give a presentation to the entire group of stakeholders.
Jorge wants to effectively communicate the successful launch of the new product and motivate
the team to continue the rest of the program.
He also needs to communicate the risks of the next phase of the project to the stakeholders.
Jorge begins by greeting the audience, introduces himself, and clearly states the purpose of
the presentation.
He uses clear and concise language and maintains eye contact to engage the audience.
He utilizes written communication skills by using slides and visual aids to support his
oral communication.
The written information is concise, relevant, and is relevant to what he is saying.
He is aware of his audience and adapts his communication style to meet the audience's
needs.
He uses personal anecdotes to create a connection and motivate his team.
He also responds to questions and feedback from the audience, demonstrating an openness
to dialogue and a willingness to work together.
Throughout the presentation, he actively listens to the audience's feedback and concerns, asking
questions, clarifying misunderstandings, and incorporating suggestions into the presentation
as appropriate.

In this video, you learned that: Effective communication enables project
managers to build trust, resolve conflicts, provide clear direction, and keep everyone
aligned during the lifecycle of a project.
Key communication skills for project managers include active listening, verbal and written
communication, interpersonal communication, and presentations.
Project managers should always aim to use clear and concise language and tailor
their message and delivery to their audience Effective presentations include employing
best practices from each of the other types of communication skills.


Project Communications Overview

Welcome to "Project Communications Overview."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the key strategies to ensure effective communication across different project 
processes.
And explain the skills a project manager must have, to design and implement effective 
communication.
Communication begins when the project starts and continues through the project end.
Ensuring smooth communication throughout the project is critical to the success of the
project.
The Project Management Institute, or PMI, recommends using three processes to ensure
effective communication with all project stakeholders throughout the project.
The processes include:
1-Plan Communications Management
2-Manage Communications, and
3-Monitor Communications
Each process provides certain key strategies to aid in effective communication.  
Let's take a look.

Plan Communications Management is about planning the management of communication.
Key strategies outlined in this first step include:
-Review the project charter, project management plan, and all pertinent project 
documentation.
-Consult with subject matter experts (SMEs) and analyse project communications 
requirements essential to success.
The consulting strategy includes:
	Understanding communications technology needs and challenges.
	And utilizing different communications methods to evaluate the team's interpersonal 
	skills to communicate effectively and meaningfully.
Step 1 ends with developing and distributing a comprehensive communications management
plan.
This plan becomes part of the formally approved and accepted project management plan and 
provides a road map to execute the project's communications strategy.
Remember, the goal is to ensure the proper communications get to the right stakeholders
in the right amounts at the right time.

After the planning is complete, the next step is to Manage Communications.
During this process, some key strategies that a project manager must follow to ensure success
include:
-Implementing the communications management plan,
-Documenting issues and developing a plan to address them,
-Ensuring technology works in their favour for all project communication,
-Using the potential from Work Performance Reports to their advantage,
S-haring information that is pertinent and valuable,
-Asking for help and support when required,
-Avoiding doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result,
-And proactively identifying what is not working in your process and proposing a plan to fix
it.

As you manage communications for the project, you should also monitor communications.
Monitor Communications is PMI's final communications process.
Some key communication effectiveness strategies essential to success include:
-Continually monitor Work Performance Data, or WPD.
This is defined as "raw" data by PMI.
WPD is informal communication from:
	Conversations, Emails, and Text messages.
New stakeholders will be needed as the project progresses.
Prior stakeholders may no longer be required on the project.
-Continually update the communications management plan to reflect where the project is in 
the lifecycle accurately.
-Ensure the formal change control system is working.
-Make sure the project is not overcome with scope creep.
-Continue to communicate effectively until the final project closure.
We discussed the key strategies for effective communication that apply to the three-step
process.
Next, let's look at some skills that a project manager must have to design and implement
effective communication.
A project manager must possess a good understanding of the different mechanisms by which 
information is exchange.
This will help the project manager to select the right mechanism to meet the stakeholder's
needs.
Common mechanisms include:
Written, which can be through physical or electronic communication.
Spoken via face-to-face or remote communication.
Gestures using facial expressions or hand gestures.
Media via pictures, actions, or even the choice of words.
Choice of words to relay a message.
There are many ways to relay a similar message through oral or written communication.
Another essential skill project managers must possess is understanding the difference between
formal and informal communication.
Formal and informal communication can be further divided into verbal and non-verbal 
communication.
Formal communication follows the rules of an organization in a respectful manner.
An example of formal communication is how you would talk to your co-workers or manager
at work.
Informal communication happens outside of an organization.
An example of informal communication is how you would talk to your friends or family.
Project managers must also understand the stakeholder's position in the project team
and adjust their content accordingly.
Key stakeholder categories include:
Upward, including senior management stakeholders.
Downward, which can be through the team or other members who contribute to the work of
the project.
And horizontal through peers of the project manager or team.
Knowledge of how to apply the 5 Cs of communication using the PMI model is also a 
mandatory skill for project managers.
Let's understand the 5 Cs.
The first C represents correct.
Ensure grammar and spelling are accurate, and the intent of the message is well-stated.
Next comes concise.
A well-crafted message reduces the chances of misunderstanding the intent.
The third C represents clear.
Ensure the needs of the stakeholders or audiences are factored into the message.
The fourth C of communication is coherent.
Ensure the flow of ideas is logical.
Use introductions and summaries.
Finally, control.
Control the flow of words using graphics or summaries.

In this video, you learned that:
Define and implement different strategies for effective communication during the plan
communications management, manage communications, and monitor communications project 
processes.
A project manager must possess different skills to design and implement effective 
communication, including:

	An understanding of when to use which communication mechanism,
	Ability to distinguish between formal and informal communication,
	And the ability to apply the 5 Cs of communication using the PMI model.


Synchronous vs Asynchronous 
Communications

Welcome to "Synchronous and Asynchronous Communication"
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Differentiate synchronous from asynchronous communication
Compare and contrast situations in which synchronous vs asynchronous
communication would be most appropriate.
There are a number of mediums of communication that you can use to communicate with your 
team, such as video conferencing, a phone call, or email. Mediums of communication fall into two 
categories, synchronous and asynchronous. Mediums of communication will be discussed in further 
detail in another video.
Synchronous communication means you're communicating with one or more people
in real time. In-person communication is the most common type of synchronous communication.
Other synchronous mediums include the telephone, voice chat, and video chat.
With asynchronous communication, the communication is not in real-time. There
is a time lapse between when a message is sent, when it is received, and when it is responded to.
Examples of asynchronous communication include voice, video, and text messages, as well as 
email.
Direct messaging can be synchronous or asynchronous and often even toggles quickly
between the two. Think about how many times you have been messaging back and forth with
someone in real-time and then all of a sudden you don't hear back, often with no notice that the
person on the other end of the conversation got sidetracked and the conversation abruptly stops.
The conversation started as synchronous but then suddenly switched to asynchronous.
Understanding the differences between these two types of communication can help you select the
right communication method for a given situation.
For instance, synchronous communication would be preferable when working on a project that 
requires real-time decision-making, while asynchronous communication might be better for tasks 
that require thought and reflection. Knowing the differences can help you better manage your 
stakeholder's time and avoid miscommunications.
In general, synchronous communication is a better option when dealing with a complex
and sensitive topic that requires interpersonal skills to navigate, such as conflict management.
Synchronous communication enables the receiver to ask clarifying questions or restate the message 
in their own words to ensure they interpreted the message correctly.
Synchronous communication is also better to build rapport. As a project manager, you will need to 
gain your team members' and your stakeholders' trust. This can best be accomplished with real-time 
conversations, both project related and more casual, informal conversations to get to know each 
other on a little more personal level.
Asynchronous communication is preferred though, if you wish to have more time to think about, 
craft, and edit your message. It is also preferred for the receiver if you wish for them to have
the time to think about and digest your message before responding. For instance, a project report
that addresses several key points containing statistics is better delivered asynchronously.
Asynchronous communication is often a better choice when you need to deliver the same message 
to a group, especially if you are working across time zones.
Coordinating schedules can be challenging and time consuming. There are certainly times when
you will need to meet at the same time as a group when you wish to have a discussion but if you are 
trying to get the same message to multiple people, asynchronous is often prudent.

In this video, you learned that:
Synchronous communication is communication that happens in real-time
Asynchronous communication is communication when there is a time lag in sending,
receiving, and responding to the communication
Synchronous communication is better when building trust or dealing with
sensitive topics such as conflict management
Asynchronous communication is a good choice when
the message needs to be carefully crafted or when communicating with a larger group .


Communications Mediums

Welcome to "Communication Mediums"
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify different communication mediums and
Describe the advantages and disadvantages of different communication mediums.
In this video, we will discuss several communication mediums that project
managers can use to communicate with their teams, including:
In-person meetings that allow for real-time interaction and collaboration Email and direct 
messaging are simple and direct ways of sending messages to team members.
Video- and audio-conferencing tools like Zoom, Skype, and Google Meet for face-to-face 
interactions, and Mobile phones can be handy when you need to contact a team member 
urgently.
The choice of communication mediums depends on the nature of the communication required, 
based on the team's location, availability, and urgency of the message. Project managers should 
choose the
most appropriate medium to ensure effective and efficient communication with their team.
Traditionally, in-person communication has been a preferred mode of communication for project 
managers.
Let's discuss some advantages of in-person communication.
Participants can gauge the reactions and feedback of other team members, making it easier to 
understand their needs and concerns.
Real-time interaction, like meetings, allows team members to work together synchronously and 
collaborate effectively.
Project managers receive immediate input and feedback from team members, making it easy to 
reach a consensus and make informed decisions.
In-person interactions can help build better relationships with team members by building rapport 
and trust, leading to a positive and productive work environment.
There can be challenges with in-person meetings as well.
These meetings can be time-consuming and expensive, especially if team members are in various 
parts of the world.
Coordinating the schedules of multiple team members can be challenging, leading to delays and 
rescheduling.
Environmental factors such as noise, distractions, and lack of privacy can also negatively impact the 
effectiveness of meetings.
Let's discuss the benefits of using electronic messaging, such as email and direct messaging.
Email programs like Outlook and Gmail and direct messaging such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and
WhatsApp provide a record of communication that any stakeholder can refer to at a later point.
Electronic messaging can be sent and received from any location on multiple devices and are low-
cost.
Both email and direct messaging allow for swift and easy communication, making them ideal for
sending quick updates, asking questions, and receiving responses in close to real time.
Electronic messaging can free up time for more important tasks rather than wasting it while trying 
to coordinate in-person or face-to-face synchronous meetings.
On the downside of these applications, project managers should be careful not to overuse these 
tools.
Direct messages can distract team members from deep work, leading to reduced focus and 
decreased productivity.
Both applications can lead to miscommunication because it is difficult to indicate tone and body 
language.
If you start to notice misunderstandings during conversations using these mediums,
find another synchronous medium, such as a video conference or phone call to clarify.
The Covid-19 pandemic brought video and audio conferencing to the front and centre of 
communication tools for many businesses. This type of communication is called face-to-face and is 
also utilized for video-on remote meetings.
Face-to-face is the optimal method of communicating. Face-to-face allows project teams to better 
schedule and participate real-time in synchronous meets from any location. Synchronous
meets may also be virtual. Video and audio conferencing also can reduce travel costs.
While video and audio conferencing are great options, there are some downsides.
Technical issues such as poor internet connectivity, equipment problems, and software compatibility 
can impact the quality of communication.
Virtual conferencing, particularly audio-only, can lack in-person communication's personal 
connection and cues. External environmental distractions can impact the effectiveness of 
communication and collaboration.
Mobile phones can be handy when you need to contact a team member urgently. However, phone 
calls and text messaging should be used judiciously during off hours and reserved only for truly 
urgent needs.
Regarding all types of communication, it is also important to note that project managers must be 
aware of their team's work-life balance. They should know team member locations, work hours, 
and paid time off.
Let's consider the case of Jordyn and how she chooses to use different communication mediums
with her team. Her team's locations encompass several time zones. She uses Outlook calendars,
which show all of her team members availabilities. She often uses
face-to-face meetings with Zoom to share her screen and display information for the team. She 
emails the team the meeting materials to preview before a meeting. She asks her team members to 
collaborate synchronously on needs basis.

In this video, you learned that:
Mediums available to project managers include in-person,
electronic messaging, virtual conferencing, and mobile phones.
Each medium has advantages and disadvantages, and PMs should use the medium that 
maximizes its benefit and minimizes its challenges.
Project managers should be aware of their team's work-life balance.


Expert Viewpoints: What's the Most Effective 
Communication Media

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: What's the Most Effective Communication Media?
In this video, experts and leaders will discuss their most effective communication media,
including their choice of when to use synchronous and asynchronous communications.
How do you decide when to use synchronous versus asynchronous communication mediums?
So, with asynchronous and synchronous different types of communication mediums,
it really depends if you need something to be done quickly, and it has to be in order.
So, during my project syncs, I only have 15 minutes with my team.
So, I want to make sure, I'm synchronous, and I'm just going through A, B, C, D:
"Is this done? Do we have any updates? Great! What's our next steps?"
Versus asynchronous, when we have a project call, and it's a working session,
then we want to allow for a lot more wiggle room, and it doesn't have to all be in order.
Synchronous and asynchronous communication. Got a lot to say on this one, folks.
So, I believe that synchronous and asynchronous communication
both definitely have their place,
but I do have a mug that says "This meeting could have been an e-mail"
and I try to take that very seriously when I'm deciding whether or not to set up a meeting.
And as project managers, when you're deciding to set up a meeting,
one of the things that you need to think about, as a good steward of the organization,
a good steward of your team's time, is that a one-hour meeting isn't just one hour.
If you have a team of 6 or a team of 10, and you call a one-hour meeting,
that's really costing your organization 6 to 10 man-hours of time
that somebody could be doing other work.
So, it's really important, again, as a steward of the organization, as steward of your team's time,
in protecting your team, to really analyse and see, "Does this situation require a meeting?"
Do I really need to call a meeting? If I do, how long does that meeting need to be?
Can we get things done in 15 minutes or half an hour instead of calling a full hour-long meeting?
And when I'm thinking about whether or not that's true, there's a couple questions that I ask myself.
So, is the matter extremely urgent?
I have a boundary and a practice where I will only respond to e-mails...
I will respond to e-mails within 24 hours.
Sometimes I respond sooner. But I respond to e-mails within 24 hours
and when I'm working on a team, I expect that same boundary from my team.
I don't expect instant replies back and forth.
Whether that's chat, e-mail, text I have a 24-hour rule.
so if a certain matter is extremely important, and it needs to be addressed
more quickly than 24 hours, then I think having synchronous communication methods:
So having a meeting, having a one-on-one, doing a quick phone call is very critical,
but if it's not that important or it's
not that urgent, and it can be responded to within 24 hours, then, of course, you can
use asynchronous methods of communication.
The other thing that I ask is, is the meeting extremely sensitive?
Is the matter extremely sensitive?
If you're dealing with a conflict, you're dealing with personnel issues or performance issues,
having an in-person conversation, or at least a video meeting, is probably your best option.
I use both synchronous and asynchronous communication every day.
Deciding which to use has actually become easier the further along I've gotten in my career.
Initially in my career, I did not have a lot of meetings,
and so I was in my inbox or in a chat system for most of the day.
Now, as I'm further in my career, I'm in meetings most of my day,
and I try to balance my early morning or late afternoon / early evening,
balance the meetings throughout the day with e-mail or chat during those times.
I am very particular about my e-mail inbox and my chats; and so,
I will have read every e-mail by the end of the day and I'll have responded where I need to.
I may not know the answer, but I'll say, "I've read your e-mail,
I should be able to get back to you tomorrow or when I know more."
Same with chats. Chats usually are a little bit more important,
and so I do try to reply to every chat during the day
with some sort of response other than, "I've seen this, and I'm thinking about it."
My nature is to learn more towards asynchronous
and so if I do find myself not having a lot of meetings
then I know that I may be defaulting to an asynchronous behaviour
when I should be getting meetings scheduled or getting on the phone and talking to people.
And then another good rule of thumb is
if you are in chat or if you are in e-mail and the threads have gone back and forth
a number of times; some people say three, some people say five
you'll want to pay attention to when;
but when the thread has gone back and forth without resolution,
or you can tell that there's confusion,
great time to pick up the phone and get people in a quick ad-hoc meeting,
talk it through and get to the decision or the answer that you need.


Effective Engagement

Welcome to "Effective Engagement."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize the best practices for effective stakeholder engagement.
Understand the stakeholder mapping scenarios with power and interest.
Describe the gulf of execution and evaluation.
And explain the tailoring considerations for stakeholder engagement.
A critical component for the success of a project is stakeholder engagement.
A project manager can keep stakeholders engaged and involved by frequently communicating 
project
updates and new information to ensure everyone is on the same page.
A project manager must ensure the right stakeholders receive the appropriate engagement level.
Identifying and leveraging existing relationships and interests between stakeholders can be
used to establish communication.
Let's review some stakeholder engagement best practices, including:
Selecting the right communication medium, and
Categorizing stakeholders.
A best practice is to select the right communication medium.
For example, if a project manager sends emails to a stakeholder who prefers face-to-face
conversations, the engagement will not be effective.
Ensure to evaluate the communication medium preferences for all key stakeholders early
in the project.
Another best practice is to categorize stakeholders.
The Project Management Institute, or PMI, provides the power and interest model for
optimal engagement strategies for stakeholders in two categories.
PMI refers to this method as stakeholder mapping.
In the stakeholder mapping method, the two categories are:
Power is defined as the ability to influence the project, and
Interest is defined as the project's impact on the stakeholder engagement.
Let's review common stakeholder power and interest scenarios.
High Power/High Interest is a scenario where the project manager must manage stakeholders
closely and clearly define the project's information and benefits.
Stakeholders in this category may be sponsors or senior management.
In a High Power/Low Interest scenario, stakeholder satisfaction is essential to project success.
Ensure to provide periodic information and updates.
Examples of stakeholders in this scenario are high-level executives who are not deeply
involved in the project.
Low Power/High Interest is a scenario where stakeholders with responsibilities must be
satisfied and informed for the project's success.
For example, customers, operations, or end users who cannot necessarily influence the
project, but need to be heard are Low Power/High Interest stakeholders.
The Low Power/Low Interest scenario requires a project manager to frequently monitor 
stakeholders.
Be aware of stakeholders and look for any changes in behaviour or status.
We looked at a few power and interest scenarios.
Let's now look at a concept called gulf of execution and evaluation.
The gulf of execution and evaluation, or cognitive gulf, was described by Donald Norman in 
his 1988 book The Design of Everyday Things.
Norman referred to it as "the difference between people's intentions and their ability
to execute them."
Imagine this. A project manager may have confidence that what they want to accomplish can be 
accomplished via a certain communication medium, such as email.
However, email communication is not taken well as the stakeholder prefers face-to-face
meetings.
In this situation, a gap is created between the project manager's expectations and the
actual results they achieve.
This gap is referred to as the gulf.
The "gulf of execution" is the gap between what the user wanted to accomplish and the
results they achieved.
The "gulf of evaluation" differs between a system's response and the user's expectation.
The "gulf of evaluation" requires the project manager to evaluate why email was
ineffective and determine better execution moving forward.
A gap in the understanding of stakeholder preferences can create challenges for successful
engagement.
For a successful engagement, the project manager should understand the preferences.
For example, different people have different preferences.
A project manager must keep the audience in mind.
Another example is the right selection of communication medium.
Choose the communication medium based on the audience preference.
After understanding the audience preferences, make sure to tailor the engagement with 
stakeholders.
Tailoring stakeholder engagement is essential.
There are three critical tailoring considerations that the PMI lists including:
1-Make sure to evaluate the skills and capabilities of the project team.
2-Determine the level of empowerment team members will have based on the project, 
environment, and organization.
3-Implement external stakeholders into the team as projects may include external 
stakeholders such as vendors, partners, or consultants.

In this video, you learned that:
Best practices in stakeholder engagement are selecting the right communications medium
and categorizing stakeholders.
Stakeholder mapping scenarios based on power and interest include:
High Power/High Interest
High Power/Low Interest
Low Power/High Interest
Low Power/Low Interest
The "gulf of execution" is the gap between what the user wanted to accomplish and the
results they achieved.
The "gulf of evaluation" differs between a system's response and the user's expectation.


For a successful engagement:
Understand the preferences, and Tailor stakeholder engagement in terms of people, 
empowerment, and integration.


Cross Cultural Communications and 
Communications Channels

Welcome to "Cross Cultural Communications and Communications Channels."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the impact of cultures on effective communications.
Explain how communication channels help in effective communication.
And describe the "grapevine."
Diversity is becoming predominant in any workforce. With diversity comes cultural differences, 
which can amplify communication differences.
A project manager needs to understand the challenges posed by culture and reduce the risk of 
ineffective project communications.
The Project Management Body of Knowledge acknowledges that culture can impact effective 
communications and references the "Browaeys and Price Cross-Cultural Communications 
Model."
The Browaeys and Price Cross-Cultural Communications Model divides the communication 
into two components:
frames of reference and communication blockers. Let's look at the components in detail.
Different individuals have naturally different frames of reference. An individual's frame of 
reference is impacted by their knowledge, experience, norms and values, and assumptions about 
business, people, and life. Cultural differences can amplify the differences in the natural frame 
of reference.
The second component in the "Browaeys and Price Cross-Cultural Communications Model" is 
cultural blockers, which can affect communication. There are several cultural blockers.
Language is a cultural blocker as it requires translation. There are times when the primary 
language of the individuals communicating is different.
Another cultural blocker is communication styles. Different people have different 
communication styles despite their cultures.
Stereotypes are another cultural blocker. Different cultures tend to stereotype others and 
assume everyone fits a single mould. Stereotypes can be damaging because they can lead to 
prejudice, ecological fallacies, and discrimination.
Another cultural blocker specified in the "Browaeys and Price Cross-Cultural Communications 
Model" is relationships. The level of your relationship can impact communications.
In some cultures, relationships and trust must be established before communications can be open.
To summarize the "Browaeys and Price Cross-Cultural Communications Model," different 
people have a diverse frame of reference. Compound this reality with the cultural realities of 
language, styles, stereotypes, and relationship factors, and you have a challenge.
The intended message sent may very well not be the message received.
Next, let's understand the concept of communication channels. PMI defines communications 
channels as the number of potential conversations that can occur.
There are four team members. In all, six potential conversations can take place.
Here is the formula to calculate the six channels for a four-person team.  
Stakeholder((Stakeholder-1)/2) =Channels.
Notice that the number of channels increases dramatically with only six team members.
Understanding the communication channels and how to calculate them will help project 
managers communicate effectively in a project.
Communication channel details are documented in the communications management plan,
which defines critical project communications items, and promptly provides information 
about using suitable mediums. The communications management plan helps the project manager 
ensure all stakeholders have the correct information about the project. The plan also ensures all 
channel members share accurate information.
A project manager must also be aware of the grapevine effect, which can be a potential risk to 
the project. "Grapevine" is how rumours spread. For example, rumours may spread if 
stakeholders and project team members do not have access to accurate and timely 
information. Again, a communications management plan mitigates the risk of the grapevine 
effect.

In this video, you learned that:
The message intended may not be the message received;
cultural blockers can affect communication.
PMI defines communications channels as the number of potential conversations that can 
occur.
The communications management plan must document the number of effective 
communication channels.
The "grapevine" is a term that shares how rumours spread.
A communications management plan mitigates the risk of misinformation.



 
Introduction to Failing Fast
Many people know Thomas Edison as the famous inventor of the modern light bulb. But did you 
know he also invented an electronic vote recorder, an electric pen, and an early home projector for 
viewing movies? Thomas Edison was a prolific inventor, but many were failures (at least at their 
onset). When he took the electronic vote recorder to congress, they told him they didn't want it. It is 
also believed that he failed many times when advancing the design of the lightbulb.
In traditional project management methodologies, project managers spend much time at the 
beginning of the project developing a project plan and defining a project scope that the team rigidly 
follows throughout the project's life. Modern project management methodologies follow an 
approach that is more focused on failing and learning fast. In this reading, you will explore what 
failing fast means, when you should take a fail-fast approach as a project manager, and what 
benefits a fail-fast approach can provide for your projects.
Failing and learning fast
As a project manager, you deliver high-quality projects that meet project objectives quickly. One 
strategy is to learn and change course as soon as you know something isn't working. In other words, 
fail fast. "Failing fast" is a concept that is often associated with agile software development, 
but it has broader applicability to many areas of business and life. At its core, "failing fast" 
means identifying failures and problems as early as possible in a project or process so that you 
can quickly pivot and adjust the course. The idea of failing fast is partially based on iterative 
development, which requires you to break projects down into small, manageable iterations. At 
the end of each iteration, the team evaluates progress and then adjusts plans as necessary. A project 
could shift or pivot completely depending on what is learned, and when implementing a fail-fast 
mindset, those pivots are encouraged. When working on a project as a project manager, you 
always manage time, resources, and budget constraints. The longer it takes you to realize that the 
feature your team is working on isn't one the customers want, that the materials that you are using 
cannot be used, or that the marketing strategy you're implementing isn't meeting objectives, the 
harder it is for you to manage those constraints. But the faster you can validate the features your 
team is building, start using a more durable material, or test your marketing message quickly, 
the easier it is to manage those constraints and see a return on investment.
Complex, uncertain, and fast-moving
A fail-fast approach is perfect for every project, and while all projects may find some benefit in 
failing fast and learning early, there are specific projects where a fail-fast approach would 
produce the most benefits.
Complex projects
Projects that involve multiple stakeholders, complex requirements, or dependencies on other 
projects or systems can benefit from a fail-fast approach. By breaking the project down into 
smaller, more manageable pieces, you can identify and address issues early and reduce the risk of 
project failure.
For example, developing a large-scale software application or platform, such as a social media 
platform or an e-commerce website, is complex. These projects involve multiple stakeholders, 
including software developers, user experience designers, product managers, and quality 
assurance specialists. Developing a large-scale software application or platform involves several 
stages, including requirements gathering, software design, development, testing, and deployment. 
These sorts of projects are perfect for a fail-fast approach where project managers and teams 
break the work into smaller iterations and aim to gather feedback from stakeholders and 
potential customers as early as possible during the project.
Uncertain projects
If a project has a high level of risk or uncertainty, a fail-fast approach can help you identify 
issues early and avoid costly mistakes. By building a minimum viable product (MVP) or 
conducting smaller experiments or pilots, you can test assumptions, identify risks, and validate 
solutions before investing too much time and resources.
A company expanding into a new country or market is an example of a high-risk project. Entering a 
new market often involves navigating cultural differences that can impact how a product or 
service is received, which may affect product features and marketing. There are also new legal 
and regulatory considerations and an established competitive landscape to manage. Using a fail-
fast approach when expanding into a new market allows project managers to develop and run 
tests to validate their product offering and messaging in a new market, quickly adapt to 
compliance and regulatory concerns, and see how established competitors react.
Fast-moving projects
Projects with tight timelines or deadlines or operating in rapidly changing environments can also 
benefit from failing fast. By being open to experimentation, breaking the project down into small 
parts, and pivoting based on feedback, you can adapt to changing conditions and increase the 
likelihood of project success.
Fast-moving projects may find a fail-fast approach beneficial, such as a company's shift to new 
artificial intelligence software to keep up with current trends. These projects often involve 
competitive and regulatory environments that change rapidly, and organizations may need to pivot 
quickly to keep up with new laws or customer requirements. Project managers can react quickly to 
these changes by using a fail-fast approach.
How to fail fast and learn
A fail-fast mentality is as much about learning as it is about failing. Here are some strategies that 
project managers can implement to fail fast while learning as much as possible.
•	Define clear objectives and metrics: Before beginning the project, define clear objectives 
and metrics for success to help the project team to stay focused on what matters and make 
data-driven decisions about which experiments and approaches to pursue.
•	Create a culture of experimentation: Encourage the project team to experiment and take 
risks. Celebrate failures as learning opportunities and encourage the team to share what they 
learned with others.
•	Test early and often: Begin testing early in the project and continue to test frequently 
throughout the project.
•	Measure and analyse results: Collect and analyse data on the results of each experiment 
and test. Data should be collected to provide insight into the defined objectives and metrics.
•	Focus on speed and efficiency: A fail-fast approach is about speed and efficiency. 
Encourage the project team to work quickly and efficiently and to focus on delivering results 
as soon as possible.
•	Encourage collaboration and communication: A failing fast approach requires 
collaboration and communication among the project team and with stakeholders. Encourage 
open and honest communication and foster a culture of transparency and trust.
•	Embrace feedback: A failing fast approach requires being open to feedback and using it to 
inform decisions and adjust the project plan and strategy. Encourage the project team to seek 
input from customers, partners, and other stakeholders and use this feedback to improve the 
project and its outcomes.
Conclusion
Project managers, and the organizations they work for, can benefit in many ways from taking a fail-
fast approach to their projects. They can identify failures and problems early on by failing fast and 
pivoting quickly to correct the course. While not the best for all projects, this approach is excellent 
for fast-moving, complex, and uncertain tasks. Project managers with a fail-fast mindset should 
make learning a top priority. To do this, they must define and measure clear objectives and 
metrics, embrace a culture of experimentation and testing early and often, and encourage 
collaboration, communication, and feedback.


When is Failing Fast Good?

Welcome to "When Is Failing Fast Good?"
After watching this video, you will be able to:
identify signs of a failing project,
and describe how failing fast can be an opportunity.
Over 60% of projects fail. The Project Management Institute, or PMI,
conducted a study concluding the five crucial areas where project failures occur, including:
Poor project selection and planning, when deadlines, budgets,
and resource limits are decided without consideration of reality.
Inconsistent sponsorship results from a lack of
engagement from the sponsor even after being informed.
Lack of scope definition awareness results in stakeholders adding elements to the scope.
Code green mentality, which is the situation when team leaders and members
only acknowledge or address problems and issues only once it is too late.
Lack of team commitment to support the project.
But how can a project manager identify if a project is moving
toward failure? Here are some warning signs to look out for.
One sign is that a project has several missed milestones and the project schedule is slipping.
Another sign is when the project is over budget.
A customer showing dissatisfaction or disinterest with the quality of
deliverables is also a warning sign.
Another warning sign that helps a project manager understand that
the project is moving towards failure is when team members and other stakeholders
exhibit burnout symptoms or a lack of commitment.
The project team losing confidence in the sponsor or vice versa is also a clear warning sign.
In addition, a warning sign is when there is a trend of
failed promises and a reduction in deliverables.
Small failures that seem to multiply into more significant ones are also something to look for.
The "failing fast" concept can help change a failing
project to a successful one before it is too late.
The failing fast approach can be implemented in certain situations,
such as when stakeholder agreements on deliverables is low,
project technical complexity is high, or the need for innovation is high.
Failing fast can be a learning opportunity. At the end of a project phase, identify what went well,
what can be improved, and the actions to take for improvement. Ensure the team shares their
experiences and uses the learning in the next phase of the project or in the next project.
Remember, effective communication can lead to real-time feedback that allows a project manager
to identify "fail fast" opportunities before they become major losses.

In this video, you learned that:
There are five crucial areas where project failures occur, including:
Poor project selection and planning,
Inconsistent sponsorship,
Lack of scope definition awareness
Code green mentality, and
Lack of team commitment.
There are different warning signs of a failing project, including:
Missed milestones and a slipping schedule
Project is over budget,
Customer dissatisfaction and disinterest in deliverables,
Team members and stakeholders exhibiting burnout symptoms,
Project team or sponsor losing confidence,
Failed promises, and
Increase in small failures.
Failing fast is a concept that helps projects go from failure to success.
Lessons learned should be conducted at the end of each project phase.


Key Project Roles
Many projects include individuals from several different roles, and each of these individuals may 
have a different communication style. As a project manager, part of your role will be to ensure that 
these different roles are able to communicate and collaborate effectively for the life of the project. 
In this reading, you'll briefly review some common project roles, learn about tools you can use to 
determine different communication styles, gain insight into some common communication styles, 
and learn how acknowledging other's communication styles can impact project success.
Review of Project Roles
Successful project managers understand that each role in a project plays a unique and important part 
in the project's success. To encourage collaboration and communication between stakeholders, it is 
important for project managers to understand the different responsibilities of each role. Some 
of the most common roles in projects include:
•	Sponsor
The sponsor is the person or group that provides the funding for the project. They are 
responsible for ensuring that the project aligns with the organization's goals and that it is completed 
within the allocated budget.
•	Product Owner
The product owner is responsible for defining the product vision and ensuring that it aligns 
with the organization's goals. They work closely with the development team to prioritize features 
and ensure that the product meets the needs of the stakeholders.
•	Scrum Master (Team Facilitator)
The scrum master is responsible for ensuring that the development team follows the agile 
methodology and scrum framework. They facilitate the daily scrum meetings, remove any 
obstacles that may be blocking progress, and ensure that the team is staying on track. Note: PMI 
refers to a Scrum Master as a Team Facilitator.
•	Business Analyst
The business analyst is responsible for analyzing the organization's needs and identifying 
areas where the project can help to meet those needs. They work closely with the product owner 
and the development team to ensure that the product meets the business requirements.
•	Core Team Members The core team members are the individuals who are responsible 
for completing the project. They include developers, designers, testers, and other 
specialists who are needed to build and deliver the product.
As a project manager, it is important to ensure that all of these roles are working together 
effectively, and managing the collaboration and communication of the different roles involved 
in a project is crucial to its success.
In a predictive project, the "Project Team" consists of the project manager, core team, and 
extended team. In an adaptive project, the team consists of the product owner, scrum master, 
and development team.
How to determine communications styles
People communicate in different ways, and understanding these communication styles is essential 
for effective collaboration. One way to determine communication styles is by using surveys, 
such as I-speak, MBTI, Emergenetics, and Insights. Look at each of these surveys and how they 
can help identify communications styles.
I-Speak Survey
The I-speak survey is a tool that helps individuals understand their communication style by 
measuring four components: Thinker, Senser, Feeler, and Intuitor.
MBTI
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment tool that helps 
individuals understand their preferences and tendencies. The tool identifies four different 
dichotomies that describe a person's preferences, including extraversion vs. introversion, sensing 
vs. intuition, thinking vs. feeling, and judging vs. perceiving.
Emergenetics
Emergenetics is a tool that helps individuals understand their thinking and behavioural 
preferences. The survey identifies four different thinking attributes and three behavioural 
attributes, which can help individuals understand how they communicate and interact with others.
Insights
Insights is a tool that helps individuals understand their communication style and how to 
communicate effectively with others. The survey identifies four colour energies that represent 
different communication styles: fiery red, sunshine yellow, earth green, and cool blue.
By taking these surveys, individuals can identify their strengths and weaknesses and learn how 
to adapt their communication style to better communicate with others.
Different types of communication styles
Since understanding the communication styles of team members can help you communicate more 
effectively with the team and improve collaboration, it is important for you to understand some 
common communication types. In each of the surveys above, the names of the communication 
styles differ, but the concepts are similar.
Thinking vs. Feeling
The thinking and feeling dimensions refer to how individuals make decisions and judgments. 
People who score high on the thinking dimension tend to make decisions based on logical analysis 
and objective facts. On the other hand, people who score high on the feeling dimension tend to 
make decisions based on their personal values and emotional responses. These dimensions can 
also be known as analytical vs. social.
Sensing vs. Intuiting
The sensing and intuition dimensions refer to how individuals perceive and process information. 
People who fall on the sensing dimension tend to process information through their five senses and 
rely on concrete, tangible information. On the other hand, people who are strong intuits tend to 
process information through patterns and connections and rely on abstract concepts and 
ideas.
Assertiveness
All of these communication styles surveys measure assertiveness as a component of 
communication. Assertiveness refers to the degree to which individuals express their opinions 
and ideas. Some individuals may be more assertive and direct, while others may be more reserved 
and indirect in their communication style.
Flexibility
Flexibility refers to the degree to which individuals can adjust their communication style to fit 
the situation and the person they are communicating with. All of these surveys measure 
flexibility, or versatility, as a component of communication. Some individuals may be more 
versatile and adaptable in their communication style, while others may be more rigid and inflexible.
It is important to note that no communication style or personality type is better than another. 
Depending on the project, or situation, some communication styles may be more preferred than 
others. It is also important to note that these characteristics exist on a spectrum, and many people 
fall somewhere in between. For example, this can mean that while typically, a person may be more 
intuitive, in certain circumstances they may process information using their senses and the data that 
is available to them.
How to acknowledge other's communication styles for maximum impact
As a project manager, understanding the communication styles of team members can help you 
communicate more effectively with the team and improve collaboration. The following are some 
ways that a project manager can use the results from communication styles surveys to communicate 
more effectively and improve collaboration:
Adjust Your Communication Style
By understanding the communication styles of team members, project managers can adjust their 
communication style to better fit the preferences of team members. For example, if a 
stakeholder prefers more data to make a decision, you may need to present more data to reach 
a decision.
Adapt Your Leadership Style
Different communication styles may require different leadership styles. Some team members may 
require more detailed instructions, while others may prefer more autonomy. Understanding the 
communication styles of team members can help project managers adapt their leadership style to 
better suit the team's needs.
Encourage Open Communication
Encourage open communication by creating an environment where team members feel comfortable 
expressing their thoughts and ideas, no matter what their communication style is. Project managers 
can create an inclusive space where team members feel heard and valued. This is especially 
important for team members who may be less assertive, particularly during meetings. As a 
project manager, you can invite them to participate during the conversation, or you can encourage 
them to participate in other ways after the meeting.
Foster Team Collaboration
Understanding the communication styles of team members can also help project managers foster 
team collaboration. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of team members, project 
managers can assign tasks that align with each team member's strengths.
Provide Communication Training
Communication styles surveys can also identify areas where team members may need additional 
communication training. Project managers can provide training to team members to help them 
communicate more effectively with each other. Understanding communication styles can also 
help when you are giving reviews.
Conclusion
When you understand the roles and responsibilities of the people on your projects and their 
unique communication styles, you can foster effective communication and collaboration. By 
using communication style and personality type surveys, you can learn more about the team 
and your stakeholders and acknowledge those communication preferences for maximum 
impact on your projects.

Project Role Identification: RACI
A project manager must ensure each team member has assigned roles and responsibilities that meet 
their skill sets and disposition whenever possible. A best practice is to develop a condensed 
stakeholder register for the team. RACI, which is an abbreviation for Responsible, Accountable, 
Consult, and Inform is a tool that helps with assigning responsibilities to team members. The table 
below is an example of a condensed stakeholder register.
Team Member Name
Assigned Role
RACI
Ram
Project Manager
RACI
Priya
Core Team Budget Lead
RACI
Sam
Core Team Budget Support
RC
Maurice
IT Technical Liaison
C
Hideki
Sponsor
AI
The project manager sets the level of responsibility using the RACI designators. These include:
R: Responsible
Any team member who has assigned tasks should be assigned an "R" role.
A: Accountable
The Accountable team member is responsible for the quality of the product regardless of their 
responsibility to create it.
Note: There should be only one accountable individual per role. For example, in the table above, 
while Priya and Sam are core team members working on the project budget, only Priya is 
Accountable for the core budget. There can only be one lead.
C: Consult
Any team member who is a technical advisor to the project can be assigned "C."
Note: The team members may or may not have additional responsibilities.
I: Inform
Any team member who needs to be informed on certain communications does not need to be 
assigned an "I" responsibility. Limit the information flow.
The project manager must ensure the team participates in RACI planning and agrees on their roles. 
People and positions may change on a project. It is, therefore, important that the project manager 
must update the RACI as the project progresses.

Expert Viewpoints: Working Together as a 
Team

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Working Together as a Team.
In this video, we experts and leaders will share their insights into how project managers gain the
cooperation of multiple roles and responsibilities and encourage people to work together.
In order to have order, technically, with all stakeholders and team members, we need to make sure 
to really grab their cooperation at the beginning of a project. So, of course, we set the expectation 
this is what your weeks are going to look like.
If you pre-schedule, it'll actually help them out to understand what the expectations are and plan 
around your meetings, with that, have successful team meetings. So, when you go to meet with 
everyone, whether it's an actual sync or working session, make sure they are organized, and 
everybody knows what they're going to be doing during those. Have successful follow-ups along 
with next steps. When you have consistency like that, you have a great, organized team.

So there's three things that come to mind right away. One is really work on your communication
skills. Clear, concise communication of facts, of accurate information, of accurate requests.
Don't ask questions that you already know the answer to to prove that you know the answer. That 
can be a real turn-off for some people in your project team.
Also, look and pay attention to what you're taking on. I think there can be a tendency for project 
managers to take on too much and sometimes tasks that somebody else in the project should be 
doing. And you don't want to be in a situation where you over-promise and then under-deliver. That 
may happen just through the nature of the project, but if you start getting a reputation for over-
promising and under-delivering then people are going to avoid wanting--people are going to avoid 
hearing your commitments, or they're not going to trust that you'll actually deliver on what it is that 
you're committing to.
Another tip for building rapport is, ask for feedback. It doesn't have to be on every project. It doesn't 
have to be on every task within a project. Somewhere in between.
You know you don't want to bug people all the time saying, "tell me how I can be better. Tell me 
how I'm going to do better." But when you do ask for feedback, be sincere about it. Be willing to 
improve based on the information that you're hearing. It should be constructive feedback that you're 
receiving, and you should be willing to listen to it, internalize it, reflect on it, and then decide if 
there's any changes that you need to make.
Hearing how other people perceive you through their feedback helps you build a relationship
with those people because then you can kind of tailor your style to better meet their needs.

First of all, define the roles and responsibilities based on the project's needs. As the project manager, 
ask the team, "Who do we need? What do we need? What skill sets are required? What subject 
matter expertise is going to be required?"
Come up with a list of personal resources or personnel resources that you require.
Time is close to that frame time.
Step number two, take this list of these are the people that I need to the sponsor.
Try to fill each position with a name. Step number three. We have our names now assigned to the 
roles and responsibilities. Try to meet with each individual. Face-to-face is wonderful. However, it's 
2023, a virtual environment sometimes is required. Ensure each individual understands their role 
and responsibilities. Make sure that they are willing to commit to support the project, and make sure 
that they have the capacity to do so.
So, if, for whatever reason, step number four, some personnel assignments may not work out, then 
identify the disconnects from the prior step. Share with the sponsor, with the key stakeholders,
with the managers that, unfortunately, your suggestion for this individual for this role may not work 
out. Negotiate. Do whatever you can to perhaps find someone new. Someone who can support this 
particular role and responsibility and then move forward.
Once you have all of the faces committed and you have all of the positions filled, finalize your 
stakeholder register and your resource management plan.
Periodically check in and address issues.
The final question in this segment that I want to address is how do you encourage people in various 
roles to work together? Well, first and foremost, ensure all of the stakeholders understand the value 
of the project, no matter how dedicated, no matter how motivated a stakeholder may be, if they 
don't see value in a project, the chances are pretty good that their motivational level is going to be 
very, very low. Secondly, ensure everyone has a clear understanding of their roles and 
responsibilities. Avoid duplication of effort. One of the worst things that you can do,
is to assign one stakeholder one role and then duplicate that with another. They're going to
be bumping into each other. There's going to be friction. There's going to be problems.
There's going to be chaos. There's going to be frustration. There's going to be unhappiness.
Thirdly, make sure that you develop a vision for your team, and at your first meeting, develop a tool 
called a team charter. This is where the team gets together, they brainstorm, document, and you gain 
consensus on ground rules, norms, and acceptable behavior that the team will commit to follow and 
hold others accountable to.

Module 2 Summary: Effective 
Communications Building Blocks

At this point in the course, you know:
•	Planning is essential to have effective conversations. It will help you get the most out of 
your conversations. Effective conversations are important for the entire team. Project 
managers should continually remind the team of their importance from the beginning of the 
project until the end.
•	Effective communication enables project managers to build trust, resolve conflicts, 
provide clear direction, and keep everyone aligned during the lifecycle of a project. Be 
it any form of communication, a project manager must learn to use clear and concise 
language and tailor conversation to different audiences.
•	A project manager must possess and practice different skills to design and implement 
effective communication.
•	Use synchronous communication for real-time conversations and asynchronous 
communication when the message needs to be carefully crafted when communicating 
with a larger group or if an immediate reply is not necessary.
•	Communication mediums available to project managers include in-person, electronic 
messaging, virtual conferencing, and mobile phones. A project manager should assess the 
pros and cons of each medium and select the medium that best suits a scenario.
•	Make sure to select the right communications medium and categorize stakeholders 
accurately. Different communication strategies must be implemented based on different 
power/interest scenarios. The gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation help understand 
the gaps in execution and measure the level of accomplishment. Effectively use 
communication channels and ensure the "grapevine" does not become the norm.
•	Failing fast is an approach that can help turn projects from failure to success. A key 
strategy in this approach is to conduct lessons-learned meetings at the end of each phase and 
the project.

Key Tool - Critical Path Method
A project manager's main goal is to successfully complete a project. To accomplish the goal, a 
project manager must address various aspects of the project, including resources, people 
skills, budgets, and different expectations. A project manager can use different tools and 
techniques to plan a project with all aspects in mind successfully. One such technique is the critical 
path method.
Several activities or tasks in a project together form the longest sequence that a project team must 
complete on time to ensure the successful completion of the project. The longest sequence is 
referred to as the critical path. A delay in any activity in the critical path can result in an 
overall delay in the project.
Using the critical path method, the project manager can determine the potential early start and 
early finish days and the potential late start and late finish days for a project. In this method, a 
project manager creates a visual of the different activities or tasks in the project. The project 
manager aims to determine the longest sequence of tasks along with the latest finish day. Here 
is an illustration of a completed Critical Path analysis.
 
 
Figure 1 Project Network Diagram
Key Terms Associated with Critical Path Method
The critical path method uses the following symbol to calculate a critical path for a project.
  
Let's look at the definitions for each of the terms.
•	Early Start (ES): The earliest time that a task can be started in the project. Make sure to 
understand the dependencies before adding this time.
•	Late Start (LS): The very last minute in which the project manager can start a task before it 
threatens to delay the project schedule.
•	Early Finish (EF): The earliest time when a task can be finished, depending on the duration 
and the earliest time when the task can start.
•	Late Finish (LF): The latest time when a task can be completed, based on its duration and 
its latest start time.
•	Slack/Float: A term that describes how long the project task can be delayed before it 
impacts other activities in the sequence and the project schedule. Note that any task on the 
critical path will have zero float because the task cannot be delayed.
Benefits of using the critical path method
•	The critical path method allows the project manager to determine work packages on 
the critical path. A project manager must manage these packages carefully. Any schedule 
slip on any critical path work package will result in a project schedule slip.
•	Work packages on non-critical paths have built-in flexibility. If hard-pressed, we can 
delay completion or borrow or "crash" resources from the non-critical path to keep the 
critical path on schedule.
•	Be careful when you crash. If you use too much slack or float, the non-critical path may 
become a new critical one.

Demo: Critical Path Method

Hello everyone and welcome to a demonstration on the Critical Path method.
Let's begin by defining the purpose of the critical path method.
Critical Path Method is a popular project management scheduling technique.
It determines the theoretical early start and early finish days and/or the theoretical late start and late 
finish days for a project.
Critical path is defined as the path of the longest duration in a project network diagram.
Here is a symbol that you want to familiarize yourself with if you are going to conduct a critical 
path analysis.
Let's begin with an overview of key acronyms that you want to understand.
ES stands for Early Start.
This is the earliest that the work package can begin.
EF stands for early finish.
This is the earliest that the work package can finish.
A work package is similar to an activity;
I'll use the term "work package" throughout this demonstration.
The duration is the time that is going to be required between the early start and the early finish.
The late start is the latest that a work package can begin and the late finish is the latest that it can 
finish.
If there is a difference between the early finish and the late finish, we have something called slack 
or float.
If there is no difference between the early finish, late finish or the early start and late start, then we 
have no slack or float.
There are two processes that need to be completed to complete a critical path analysis.
The first is called a forward pass.
For a forward pass, we're going to determine the early start and the early finish for each work 
package.
We're going to move left to right, from the early start to the early finish, for each particular work 
package in sequence.
We will complete all of the paths.
Once we do this, we can determine the path of the longest duration, which is the critical path.
The second procedure we're going to perform is a backwards pass.
The backwards pass helps us to determine the late start and the late finish.
In this particular case, we're going to move from back to front, right to left.
We're going to begin with each work package's late finish, and we're going to move to the late start.
Very important, complete the critical path first.
If you do not create, if you do not complete the critical path first, then your results may be 
erroneous.
Once we complete the critical path, then we're going to complete the non-critical path, from the 
longest path to the shortest.
So with that, let's go ahead and take a look at an example.
And we're going to begin with a forward pass.
Again, a forward pass; we're going to determine the early start and the early finish for each of our 
work packages.
Let's begin with Path A, D, and G.
We begin with day number one.
This is a three-day duration work package.
So, what is the early finish? 1, 2, 3.
We go to work package D and we add one day.
We begin work package D the following day.
We ended A on day three; we begin D on day four.
This is three days in duration: 4, 5 and 6.
So, now we have our early finish of day number six.
We're completing PATH A-D-G, so we move forward to work package G and we go to the next day 
for the early start, day number seven.
This is four days in duration: 7, 8, 9, 10.
And now, we have the time frame required to complete A, D, and G: ten days.
Now we still have A, D, and E.
We've already calculated A and D.
However, E follows D, so therefore,
we ended D the early finish on day six. So, the early start is going to be day seven.
This is a five-day duration work package 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
So now we have the early finish for Path A, D, and E; 11 days.
A little bit longer than A, D, and G, which was ten days.
We now have one final forward pass to complete; Path B, C, and F.
So, we're going to begin on day number one with our early start for the first work package, B.
three days in duration one, two, and three for our early finish.
We begin the next day for our early start for our work package C, day number four.
This is a longer duration work package; Seven days, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. So, our early finish is 
day number ten.
The next in sequence is work package F, we add one day for the early start: day number 11. Six day 
duration: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
We now know that Path B, C and F is going to require 16 days.
And we've learned something very important: which is the path of the longest duration?
Which is the critical path?
The critical path is BCF, 16 days.
This project is going to require 16 days.
Now we need to go ahead and perform a backwards pass.
So, to perform a backwards pass, the first thing you need to do is to put the critical path duration
as the late finish for all of the final work packages in each particular path.
For ADG, we're going to go ahead and put the late finish at 16
For ADE we're going to put the late finish at 16.
And we're going to do the same for BCF.
Now, remember, for a backwards pass, the rule is we always begin with the critical path,
and we determined through our forward pass that BCF is the critical path, 16 days.
So, we begin with day number 16 and the late finish, but now we're going to work backwards.
This is six days in duration, so we have to subtract: 16, 15, 14, 13, 12 and 11.
We put the number 11 for 11 days in the late start.
Now, we're going to go backwards one day.
This is a backwards pass.
So, for work package C in the late finish, we put in ten.
This is seven days in duration; we count back seven days. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4
And we place four in the late start.
Minus one day as we move backwards to work package B, Day number three, three days in 
duration. Countdown three, two and one.
Now, let's take a look at what we have completed for BCF. Every box is filled.
We want to compare the early finish and the late finish and see if there is a difference, in this 
particular case, there is no difference.
The early finish is 16 days. The late finish is 16 days.
When we subtract this, we end up with zero.
Let's validate by doing the same for the early start and the late start.
Is there any difference between 11 and 11?
The answer is no; we put zero in this box, which is the slack or the flow.
What do we mean by that?
It means that the early finish and late finish are the same as the early start and the late start;
We have no slack. We have no flow. This is the critical path.
We validate work package C: 10, 10. 4, 4. No difference. Zero flow and slack.
Work package B: 3, 3. 1, 1. No flow, no slack, zero.
Now, very important, which is the path of the next-longest duration?
That is A, D, and E.
So now we're going to do the same methodology.
We put 16 days, which is our critical path, in the late finish,
and we're going to subtract backwards five days, which is the duration,16, 15, 14, 13, and 12.
We put the 12 in the late start.
But now let's notice something very important:
There is a difference between the early finish and late finish of five days.
There is a difference between the early start and late start
of five days.
We put the five in this particular box; the slack and the flow.
What do we mean by that?
It means the earliest we can start work package E is day 7. The latest we can start it is day 12.
We have a little bit of leeway in terms of when we need to start this work package
for it to be completed by day number 16,
ADE are connected on a singular path.
We go day number 12 and then we go to D, which is the work package which precedes E
and we subtract one day, day number 11, subtract three, 11, 10 and 9.
Again, we have that difference.
6 compared to 11, 4 compared to 9.
We have float/slack of five days.
We subtract one day from D to calculate work package A, that's day number eight.
Subtract three, 8, 7, 6.
Again, we have that difference of five
between the late finish and early finish and the late start and the early start; we have float and slack 
of five days.
This leaves us with one final activity for the backwards pass--and why do we save it for last?
Because 10 is less than 11 and far less than 16.
So, we do the same methodology. The late finish gets 16 days. This is four days in duration.
Let's count backwards four days. 16, 15, 14, 13.
And now we can go ahead and take a look at the difference between the early finish and the late 
finish and the early start and the late start, and this is six days.
So, for our work package, G, we have the most flow and the most slack.
We have a six-day window in which we can go ahead and plan our early start or late start
to still complete this worst case scenario, by 16 days, which is our critical path.
This concludes our overview of this demo.
Hopefully, critical path analysis makes a little bit more sense to you.
We hope that you're able to go ahead and apply what you learned in a lab that we have planned for 
you, where you will take a look at a scenario and develop and perform a critical path analysis.
Thank you for your attention. Have a great rest of your day, and we look forward to seeing you 
again in future presentations and demos.

Critical Chain Method

Welcome to "Critical Chain Method."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define critical chain method.
Describe the steps involved in developing a schedule using critical chain method.
Define differences between critical chain and critical path methods.
And identify when to use critical chain method.
Imagine this: You're part of a 4 by 200 meter relay race.
The exercise is simple:
Run the 200 meters, pass the baton to the next person, and
follow the process till the last person completes their 200 meters.
During this time, several things might happen.
For example, a runner may fall, slow down, or increase their speed.
The goal is to continue to hand off the baton until every runner has reached the end line.
At the beginning of the race, the team may take the time
to select the runners and understand their dependencies during the race, such as the track, weather, 
shoes, and so on.
In addition, a runner only runs or passes the baton at a given point in time.
They cannot perform both actions at the same time.
The team plans for resource shortages; they have an extra runner on board, just in case.
The team also plans for time delays.
They practice the baton exchange and allocate extra time for the exchanges in case of an exchange 
issue.
They never lose sight of their goal.
They want to finish the race as quickly as possible and win.
The critical chain method is similar to a relay race.
The critical chain method is a project management technique that emphasizes the resources such as 
as people, equipment, supplies, materials, and physical space required to execute project tasks.
Critical chain was developed as an alternative to the critical path method.
When using the critical chain method, project managers plan project schedules with a focus 
on resource and time constraints.
The project manager identifies the longest sequence of resource-dependent activities.
The sequence is referred to as the critical chain.
The project manager includes buffers to protect the critical chain from resource shortages 
and delays and to ensure that the project is completed on time.
At a high level, developing a critical chain can be divided into four steps.
The first step is identifying the different activities and creating a network diagram.
Identify the paths, including the critical path.
In the network diagram displayed, path EFG is the critical path.
Paths AB and CD are required activities to complete the project, But they're not on the critical path.
The second step is determining the potential for resource shortages or issues on the non-critical 
paths.
Add extra resources in anticipation of resource risks materializing.
Ensure resource issues do not delay the non-critical paths to the point where the critical path is 
jeopardized.
These are called resource buffers.
The next step is to add feeding buffers, which add extra time to the non-critical paths.
Feeding buffers assume that extra time or float will likely disappear.
For example, let's say the critical path EFG is 14 days.
Path AB is scheduled for ten days.
A feeding buffer is placed on path AB to plan for 12 days.
If the work is completed in 10 days, great!
However, there is a possibility of risks occurring.
Therefore, plan for 12 days.
Remember, resource buffers also help in ensuring delays are minimal.
This step is performed with each path.
The last step is to plan for the worst-case scenario.
In this example, the critical path EFG will take 14 days.
Resources and time have been added to the non-critical paths
to ensure they are not delayed to the point where the critical path is impacted.
But what if the critical path activities are delayed?
To address this scenario, add a project buffer at the end of the project.
Let's say this is 2 days.
In this case, at a worst-case scenario, the project will complete in 16 days.
This completes the overview of the steps in the critical chain method.
Critical chain method is similar to critical path method However, there are a few key differences 
between critical path methodology and critical chain methodology; these include:
Critical path methodology assumes that the length of tasks and their dependencies are the major 
constraints, while critical chain methodology assumes that resources are a project's major 
constraint.
Critical path methodology simply defines the amount of slack or float for each activity, while 
critical chain methodology adds resource buffers between tasks and adds additional time buffers at 
the end of a project if needed.
Because of these differences, when using critical path methodology, project teams can be working 
on multiple project tasks at a time, whereas with critical chain methodology, project teams focus on 
one critical task at a time before they're able to move onto another.
Critical path methodology and critical chain methodology are both project management planning 
techniques, but they have different approaches and applications.
You should use critical path methodology when the project is well-defined, there's a high level of 
certainty in the task duration and resource availability, and the project is relatively simple, with a 
straightforward sequence of tasks.
For example, planning an event with a clear sequence of tasks and a fixed timeline.
You should use critical chain methodology when the project is complex and uncertain, there are 
significant risks and variability, and the availability of resources is limited, or resources are shared 
across multiple projects.
For example, researching and developing a new pharmaceutical drug.
In this video, you learned that:
Critical chain method adds the availability of resources and their dependencies while determining 
the minimum time required to complete the project.
There are four key steps in the critical chain method.
Critical path methodology is best for well-defined projects, while critical chain methodology is best 
for uncertain projects.

Key Tool - Communications Management Plan

Welcome to "Key Tool: Communications Management Plan."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize the purpose of a communications management plan.
Describe the components of a communications management plan.
Project Management Institute, or PMI, states that communications impact 90% of all project
management activities. This shows effective communication is key to project success.
The PMI recommends using a communications management plan to ensure communication for the 
project is organized and effective.
A communications management plan provides the overall strategy to describe how best to 
communicate with each other and communicate responsibilities based on project requirements.
The project manager must create the communications management plan during project planning and 
frequently update the plan as the project progresses.
The PMI provides some input into the process of a communications management plan. Let's look at 
some of the purposes.
Every project has its communication requirements. For example, a software development 
project may have very different communication requirements than a job modernization project from 
the HR department. The project manager will need to develop and tailor the communications 
management plan to support the information needs of each stakeholder or group of stakeholders and 
the overall project.
Creating a communications management plan gives the overall communication process a 
documented structure. A communications management plan aids in creating a positive 
communication rhythm for the project. For example, when a team member knows precisely where 
to find a report and when to publish the report, communication is more efficient and effective 
communication.
A communications management plan provides guidance on communication at different levels. This 
guidance helps each stakeholder to identify the right people, the right time, and the right content 
level for communication.
The result of this understanding is that each project stakeholder can effectively and efficiently 
engage with other stakeholders by promptly presenting relevant information.
For example, during an internal status meeting, a project manager may need to go into all the 
minute details of the project. However, with a sponsor, the level of detail may need to be at a macro 
level focusing only on the completion percentage.
We discussed the purpose of having a communications management plan. A communications
management plan template is normally available in either Microsoft Word or Excel.
The PMI states that a communications management plan should have certain components. 
Let's see the components of a communications management plan.
The communications management plan must have a project name to map the plan with the 
correct project title.
You can add different communications items. A communications item represents a type of
communication. Examples include status meetings, budget meetings, change boards, and so on.
Each communications item must have an associated:
Owner: Identifies the project team member responsible for managing the communications item.
Audience: Describes the project team members and stakeholders who will receive the 
communication. Ensure to select the right people.
Timing: Sets a schedule for the communications item. For example, weekly status meetings will
occur every Wednesday from 11:00 AM to 11:30 AM. Manage exceptions on need basis.
Format or Medium: Determines how the team needs to conduct the communications item. For 
example, face-to-face meetings, virtual meetings, emails, and so on.
Purpose: Identifies the need for the communications item. For example, a weekly status meeting 
aims to review the current project status, understand potential issues, and answer any open 
questions.
The communications management plan is frequently updated. It is a good idea to maintain the 
version number and date of change to maintain version control.

In this video, you learned that:
A communications management plan:
Is created during project planning and frequently updated, supports the information needs of a 
project, provides communication strategy for the project, aids in positive communications rhythm,
and helps identify the right people, time, and content level for communication. The components of 
a communication management plan include the project name, communications item details, 
version, and date.
The communications items details include item description, owner, audience, timing, format or 
medium, and purpose.


Business Analyst Communication 
Requirements
Objective
•	Differentiate between the communications requirements of a Business Analyst compared to 
a Project Manager
Communication requirements for a Business Analyst 
vs. Project Manager
The Business Analyst and the project manager must work closely together to plan and implement 
the project to benefit the organization. The Communications Management Plan should include the 
Business Analyst as a key stakeholder, and in some cases, may lead communications item activities.
A Business Analyst focuses on ensuring that the right requirements are defined before the Project 
Charter is developed. The project manager is presented with requirements by the Business Analyst 
and communicates with stakeholders to execute the solution.
The Business Analyst has specific communication responsibilities. These include:
•	Lead collaboration with key stakeholders to identify problems and opportunities, assess the 
current product state, determine an acceptable future state, and brainstorm viable options. 
The project manager is often a participant in these conversations.
•	Facilitate the development of product roadmaps and business cases that will drive future 
programs and projects.
•	Assist the project manager in developing project charters and preparing pre-baseline 
presentations to sponsors to gain approval.
•	Assist the project manager in identifying and analysing stakeholders to determine an optimal 
communications approach.
•	Lead business analysis planning activities and assist the project manager in developing a 
project transition plan.
•	Determine the best requirements elicitation approach, prepare for and conduct elicitation, 
and confirm elicitation results.
•	Determine requirements analysis approaches and applicable models to use, support the 
project manager during requirements prioritization activities, and assist in risk identification 
and management.
•	Develop a Traceability Matrix that defines the product development stages and allows the 
project manager to ensure they communicate effectively with all key stakeholders.
•	Assist the project manager in developing a change management process to manage changes 
to requirements and other products.
•	Assist the project manager in determining project performance evaluation and acceptance 
criteria.
Conclusion
Business Analysts and project managers work as a team to ensure project success. Together they 
ensure that the right products are identified, planned, executed, and delivered to address 
organizational problems and achieve opportunities.


Demo: Communications Management Plan

Hello, everyone.
I'd like to go ahead and take a few moments and present a brief demo on a communications
management plan.
A communications management plan is a formal part of a project management plan,
and the intent of a communications management plan is to provide a roadmap for all project
communications,
to ensure that communications gets to the right person at the right time in the right
amount.
According to the Project Management Institute, a communications management plan should have
an introduction. As you can see,
we have the communications plan for a two-day all hands event.
This is just an example.
Always try to define the project, because there may be multiple projects and multiple 
communications
management plans.
A communication management plan has six areas that need to be populated.
The first area is what we refer to as the communications item, sometimes called the
forum.
This is what you are communicating.
As you can see on this particular example, we have three that are highlighted: the weekly
project status meeting,
the sponsor one-on-one meeting and the Weekly Project Status Report.
We have some others as well:
A Change Control Board, Vendor Source Selection, Conference Room Presentation.
So, the first step in developing the communications plan is step number one, define the required
communication items. As the project manager,
enlist the support of your core team and try to determine what needs to be communicated
and populate this first column.
The second step is to determine the owners.
Every communication item should have a specific owner who is responsible for planning and
implementing that particular line item.
In this particular case, the weekly project status meeting is going to be owned by Sanjay
Randall.
Sanjay is going to be the individual who is empowered to go ahead and plan and implement
and ensure that the weekly project status meeting happens.
We have others as well.
We have Roger Jones, who is going to be the sponsor one-on-one meeting the weekly project
status report.
By the way, a sponsor one on one meeting is a best practice.
It is a very, very good thing for the project manager to meet periodically with the sponsor
and have conversations about status and other key areas as well.
The third step in developing the communication plan, as you can see over in my green column
here, is to determine the audience.
Here's a little bit of a tip.
Everyone who's on the stakeholder register should be included in this communications
plan.
If you have someone on the stakeholder register who was identified having a role and responsibility
and they're not on this plan,
you may want to question why you have them on the stakeholder register and why you are
assigning them a role and responsibility if you're not going to communicate with them.
Not communicating with people on the stakeholder register,
to use a colloquialism, is an accident waiting for a place to happen.
Step number four determine the timing.
When are we going to go ahead and implement this particular communications item?
Some may be weekly.
Some may be two times each week.
Some may be just a one time, such as the vendor source selection.
Ensure that you understand how often this communications line item needs to occur and
document it in the fourth column.
The next is to complete the medium.
What medium are we going to go ahead and use?
And in terms of where are we going to meet?
As you can see, in some cases, we have a location, the main conference room, Sarah's office.
In other cases, we may actually have a technology such as SharePoint as well.
So sometimes we don't meet individually or in an office.
We meet electronically using SharePoint.
Always and with a purpose as well.
It's very, very important that all of the individuals who are going to be receiving
information as part of this communications plan have an understanding of the purpose,
why this is important as well.
So, once you have completed all six of these items and you have defined the project title
on the top of the plan, go to step number five,
validate the plan with the audience, have a meeting with all of these audience members.
Let them know what the expectations are.
Don't surprise them by sending them communications items without some kind of a heads up as 
well.
Ensure you get some kind of verbal signoff from each one in the audience, that they understand
what the communication line item is.
They understand the purpose of it, and they're willing to go ahead and support that particular
communications line item.
Once you gain that validation, publish it and follow the plan.
One of the worst things you can do as a project manager is to develop this plan, put it in
the project management plan, and then conduct communications in a random manner.
The last step in communications planning is update as needed.
You'll notice on the bottom we have version and date.
This plan is going to change as the project is initiated.
There are going to be certain communications items that are required.
But as the project progresses, more and more communications will be required and some of
the prior communication items may no longer be required as well.
In addition, the audience may very well change as the project progresses.
Individuals who needed and required communications early in the project may no longer require
these communications,
toward the middle and end of the project.
So be consistent and keep this plan accurate.
You will have an opportunity to read a scenario and develop a communications management plan
based on that scenario.
I highly encourage you to do your best in that lab and try to understand how this plan
is developed and appreciate the overall value proposition of this plan.
It's a very, very important planning activity in project planning.
And again, if you develop this communications management plan, it will act as a road map
and help guide effective communications.
Thank you very much for your time listening to this demo, and we look forward to seeing
you and future demo videos.
Have a great rest of your day.






Hello, everyone.
I'd like to go ahead and take a few moments and present a brief demo on a communications
management plan.
A communications management plan is a formal part of a project management plan,
and the intent of a communications management plan is to provide a roadmap for all project
communications, to ensure that communications gets to the right person at the right time in the right
amount.
According to the Project Management Institute, a communications management plan should have
an introduction. As you can see, we have the communications plan for a two-day all hands event.
This is just an example.
Always try to define the project, because there may be multiple projects and multiple 
communications management plans.
A communication management plan has six areas that need to be populated.
The first area is what we refer to as the communications item, sometimes called the forum.
This is what you are communicating.
As you can see on this particular example, we have three that are highlighted: the weekly
project status meeting, the sponsor one-on-one meeting and the Weekly Project Status Report.
We have some others as well:
A Change Control Board, Vendor Source Selection, Conference Room Presentation.
So, the first step in developing the communications plan is step number one, define the required
communication items. As the project manager, enlist the support of your core team and try to 
determine what needs to be communicated and populate this first column.
The second step is to determine the owners.
Every communication item should have a specific owner who is responsible for planning and
implementing that particular line item.
In this particular case, the weekly project status meeting is going to be owned by Sanjay
Randall.
Sanjay is going to be the individual who is empowered to go ahead and plan and implement
and ensure that the weekly project status meeting happens.
We have others as well.
We have Roger Jones, who is going to be the sponsor one-on-one meeting the weekly project
status report.
By the way, a sponsor one on one meeting is a best practice.
It is a very, very good thing for the project manager to meet periodically with the sponsor
and have conversations about status and other key areas as well.
The third step in developing the communication plan, as you can see over in my green column
here, is to determine the audience.
Here's a little bit of a tip.
Everyone who's on the stakeholder register should be included in this communications
plan.
If you have someone on the stakeholder register who was identified having a role and responsibility
and they're not on this plan, you may want to question why you have them on the stakeholder 
register and why you are assigning them a role and responsibility if you're not going to 
communicate with them.
Not communicating with people on the stakeholder register, to use a colloquialism, is an accident 
waiting for a place to happen.
Step number four determine the timing.
When are we going to go ahead and implement this particular communications item?
Some may be weekly.
Some may be two times each week.
Some may be just a one time, such as the vendor source selection.
Ensure that you understand how often this communications line item needs to occur and
document it in the fourth column.
The next is to complete the medium.
What medium are we going to go ahead and use?
And in terms of where are we going to meet?
As you can see, in some cases, we have a location, the main conference room, Sarah's office.
In other cases, we may actually have a technology such as SharePoint as well.
So sometimes we don't meet individually or in an office.
We meet electronically using SharePoint.
Always and with a purpose as well.
It's very, very important that all of the individuals who are going to be receiving
information as part of this communications plan have an understanding of the purpose,
why this is important as well.
So, once you have completed all six of these items and you have defined the project title
on the top of the plan, go to step number five, validate the plan with the audience, have a meeting 
with all of these audience members.
Let them know what the expectations are.
Don't surprise them by sending them communications items without some kind of a heads up as 
well.
Ensure you get some kind of verbal sign-off from each one in the audience, that they understand
what the communication line item is.
They understand the purpose of it, and they're willing to go ahead and support that particular
communications line item.
Once you gain that validation, publish it and follow the plan.
One of the worst things you can do as a project manager is to develop this plan, put it in the project 
management plan, and then conduct communications in a random manner.
The last step in communications planning is update as needed.
You'll notice on the bottom we have version and date.
This plan is going to change as the project is initiated.
There are going to be certain communications items that are required.
But as the project progresses, more and more communications will be required and some of the 
prior communication items may no longer be required as well.
In addition, the audience may very well change as the project progresses.
Individuals who needed and required communications early in the project may no longer require
these communications, toward the middle and end of the project.
So be consistent and keep this plan accurate.
You will have an opportunity to read a scenario and develop a communications management plan
based on that scenario.
I highly encourage you to do your best in that lab and try to understand how this plan is developed 
and appreciate the overall value proposition of this plan.
It's a very, very important planning activity in project planning.
And again, if you develop this communications management plan, it will act as a road map and help 
guide effective communications.
Thank you very much for your time listening to this demo, and we look forward to seeing you and 
future demo videos.
Have a great rest of your day.

Expert Viewpoints: Planning for Effective 
Virtual and In Person Communications

Welcome to "Expert Viewpoints: Planning for Effective Virtual and In-Person Communications."
In this video, experts and leaders will provide tips for effective communications planning,
particularly in a virtual environment.
What tips can you provide for effective communications planning,
particularly in a virtual environment?
Tips for effective communication planning.
I wrote this first one on my cheat sheet in all uppercase letters:
"Look at people's calendars for their busy and free time."
One of my biggest pet peeves is when I receive a calendar appointment.
And the person who sends it is double- if not triple-booking me.
I am a fiend about keeping my calendar current, and so when people who are scheduling meetings
don't take the time to look at my calendar for free/busy, and I'm a required member or participant in 
the meeting, it just makes me nuts.
And I know that I can propose a new time that works in my calendar, but I'm not the organizer of 
the meeting, and so I shouldn't have to look through calendars to find that for me plus all the other 
participants.
So, that's my big one is look at calendar availability when you're booking.
Second tip for effective communication.
Know the time zones that your project team is in, especially if you're a global team and you have 
people around the world.
understand that they're going to be working in their mornings, afternoons, and evenings, and then to 
plan your meetings and plan your connections with them accordingly.
Being sensitive to their working hours will help them be sensitive to your working hours, so also 
establish your own boundaries as far as, as far as working hours go.
And then make sure that you find out team holidays; different countries, of course, have different 
holidays.
And then also personal time away, if people are going to take vacations.
That also helps you plan for your timeline, how you're going to manage when people are out,
and more.
And then last, of course, I think you've probably already heard this, but when you are in meetings,
if one person turns their video on, everyone should turn their video on.
If people are sensitive to the room that they're in, go ahead and blur your background.
But do take advantage of the video, take advantage of earbuds and headsets to block out noise from 
other places in the house, and then also if you hear dogs barking, make sure that you can, try to get 
your dog settled down so they don't interrupt your video recording For effective communications 
planning, I like to get a sense, before I plan the communications, of each of my stakeholder's 
communication needs and preferences.
So, I like to spend a little bit of time, either one-on-one with a stakeholder or the team, or even just 
through an e-mail, gathering the communication preferences of those people.
And I like to put, you know, all of that information in a singular place that I can go back and refer to
when I'm doing communications planning.
And that helps me, as I'm building my communications plan, think through what communications 
methods am I going to use, what tools am I going to use? Those sorts of things.
Another thing that I am a really big fan of is, I always have a communications plan template. I think 
it just makes, having a template and always starting from that template and always following the 
same process because you're using a template really helps you not have to think "am I forgetting 
something?" Am I forgetting a key stakeholder? Am I forgetting a type of communication that I 
need to possibly include in this communications plan? but having a template just really makes 
things a lot easier and it makes you much more effective as you're planning those communications.
When it comes to planning in a virtual environment, I think understanding the tools that are at your 
disposal and really understanding what features they have.
So, if you're, you know having a virtual call, a virtual video call, are people going to be able to view 
a recording? Is there a transcription service available that transcribes that recording?
Where are those videos going to be saved? Are you going to need to communicate where those 
videos are saved after each meeting so that people can actually access them ?
But really kind of understanding the technology that you're using:
How do you actually set up the meetings?
What things do people maybe need to download onto their computers
before they join the first meeting?
To be able to access that meeting and to be able to get on the meeting?
All of those things are really important. The technology piece is really important.
and adding those things to your communication plan, so if, for example, you need to send out a link 
to the meeting recording after every meeting.
It's important for you to plan for that communication in your communications plan and then 
potentially build a template: build a template that says,
"Hi team, here is the link to our meeting recording from today. You can access it here."
and then you can go back to that template, and you already have it written, it's already done.
And then when you're in your communications plan, you can send it off very quickly and be done 
with it.
So having templates, understanding the technology, and really understanding the needs of your 
team, communication needs of your team and stakeholders is very important for effective 
communications planning.

First off, make sure that you have all the right stakeholders involved.
Not everybody needs to attend every meeting needs to be on every type of email or something like 
that.
Different types of tools that you can use:
I love Slack, to be honest. A lot of companies use different things, like Teams have a great support 
system as far as a storage box they can put documentations into. That makes it a lot easier for your 
team members to find information. Email, phone call--a lot of people don't call any more;
That's a great opportunity for a one-on-one session.

Project teams should always have a discussion on preferred communication style, how 
frequently, what method, what has worked for them in the past, what hasn't.
And even though your team will collectively decide on a communication plan, every project 
manager is smart enough to know that you need to learn your team members' individual 
preferences.
For example, you don't want to upset someone by calling them unannounced at 3:30 when you 
know that they pick up their child every day from school during that time.
Get to know your team and adapt to their styles.

Planning Virtual Communications

Welcome to "Planning Virtual Communications.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain the key indicators that measure the effectiveness of virtual meetings.
And summarize communications planning tips to accommodate a virtual environment.
The PMI defines virtual meetings as opportunities to interact using communication 
technology.
Virtual meetings are essential in today's work environment, such as making decisions, solving 
problems, responding to stakeholder requests, and providing information.
Let's look at some key parameters that can help measure the effectiveness of virtual meetings.
A key parameter to measure virtual meeting effectiveness is attendance. Typically, a poorly run 
virtual meeting tends to have fewer participants, which may often point to a lack of perceived value 
from the meeting and no accountability for not attending.
Participants may also need help to connect to a meeting or other technology challenges.
Another parameter is the level of participant interaction. When people are engaged, they are 
attentive, contributing, and maximizing the value of the meeting or event.
Participation in polls is another parameter to measure the effectiveness of virtual meetings. Lower 
participation may indicate a lack of focus or interest.
Make sure to conduct periodic polls. Strive to attain 100% participation.
The most important parameter to measure the effectiveness of a virtual meeting is the outcome. It is 
important to validate if the meeting achieved its intended purpose. If not, it is important to 
understand why the purpose was not achieved and continuously improve.
We discussed the measurement parameters for the effectiveness of virtual meetings. Next, let's look 
at some tips on improving the effectiveness of virtual meetings.
The first tip to improve virtual meeting effectiveness is to establish ground rules. Ground rules 
help project teams to communicate effectively, collaborate, and make decisions during a virtual 
meeting.
Some examples of ground rules include:
Be punctual,
Keep cameras on,
Start and end on time,
Ask relevant questions, and
Mute when others speak.
Every participant must be well-conversant with using the technology or software for the meeting.
Conduct technology training, if required.
Another tip to improve the effectiveness of virtual meetings is to ensure that every meeting has a 
well-defined agenda.
Make sure to publish the meeting agenda to all participants. The agenda should have clear 
objectives stated to help align all participants. At the end of the meeting, the project manager must 
publish the meeting minutes.
Here is an example of a clearly defined agenda.
Having the right people in a meeting is essential to be effective. Determine who needs to attend the 
meeting and ensure the participant understands why their attendance is critical.
For example, when setting up a weekly project status meeting, the project manager must invite the 
team members. However, the project sponsor or senior leadership may be optional.
Only invite participants who need to be at the meeting.
When selecting the right participants, ensure backup participants in case a key participant cannot 
attend. Also, ensure that the proxy identified is empowered to make decisions.
Another tip to make the virtual meetings effective is to involve participants. Here are some 
examples to involve participants.
Divide responsibility for presenting topics among the participants. This will increase overall 
engagement.
Encourage participants to share ideas and thoughts via the chat function. This will bring openness 
and engage the participants.
Schedule periodic check-ins with key participants. This will help solicit feedback throughout the 
meeting.
Leverage technology. Introducing periodic break-out room discussions may increase interaction and 
help break the monotony of the meeting.

In this video, you learned that:
Parameters to measure the effectiveness of virtual meetings include attendance, level of 
participant interaction, polls, and outcomes.
Tips to improve the effectiveness of virtual meetings include:
Establish ground rules
Technology awareness
Meeting agenda
Participant selection
Proxy participant identification
Involve participants


Status Reporting

Welcome to "Effective Status Reporting."
After watching this video, d for periodic work performance reports.
Explain the significance of status reporting.
And, describe the attributes of a good status report.
The Project Management Institute (PMI) discusses the need for periodic work performance reports.
These reports include status reports, memos, justifications, dashboards, and more.
Periodic work performance reports support the following:
better decision-making, identifying and raising issues, defining required actions, and creating 
awareness in the team and other stakeholders.
Status reports are one of the most frequently used categories of periodic work performance 
reports.
According to PMI, a status report provides the status of a project.
The report may include information on progress since the last report and forecasts for cost and 
schedule performance.
Typically, a status report is created weekly.
However, the frequency may increase or decrease depending on the project requirement.
It is important to document the definition and need for status reporting and its frequency in 
the communications management plan, during the project planning phase.
The project manager is responsible for establishing status reporting formats and submission 
schedules.
In most cases, organizations use a standard status report template across projects.
For the status report to be effective, it should have some attributes. Let's look at these attributes.
The status report should have an audience focus.
Ensure to tailor content according to the audience.
For example, a weekly status report may contain several line items for development
as the audience is all project team members.
At the same time, a monthly project report to senior management
may contain high-level milestone details.
Another key attribute of an effective status report is that it is short.
Ensure that the status report is one page or shorter.
Use links to review details, if needed.
It is also important to format a status report for better readability.
Share the essential information first, followed by secondary information.
For example, a milestone achieved or a requirement change may be something to highlight at the 
start of the report.
You can also add a high-level summary of the project areas.
Adding factual data to the status report is important.
However, make sure you only add information stakeholders require.
For example, summarize the development status instead of providing a line-by-line detail.
Use graphs or visuals to improve readability.
Varied audiences, such as technical, non-technical, senior or junior, will use the status report.
Keep the language simple to enable varied audiences to understand the status report.
Limit the use of technical jargon.
Add a glossary at the end of the status report.
Use this section to add definitions for technical jargon.
Also, add legend descriptions for any graphs or visual aids.
A project team and stakeholders may include people with disabilities, such as colour-blindness;
make the report inclusive.
Ensure to use symbols along with colours to improve readability for all audiences.
Putting a status report together takes time.
Make sure to set realistic expectations with team members to receive all information.
Similarly, set realistic expectations with stakeholders for sharing the reports.
Ensure the author takes accountability.
The project manager may delegate status report collection and distribution responsibility
to a project core team member.
However, the project manager remains accountable for the quality of the report.
Here is an example of a status report.

In this video, you learned that:
Periodic work performance reports help in various aspects of project management, including 
decision-making and issue identification and resolution.
The status report is a frequently used periodic work report
to provide a project's current status.
The attributes of a good status report include the following:
Focuses on the right audience It is short and to the point
Starts with the essential information Contains factual data
Uses simple language Sets realistic expectations
Adheres to accessibility norms Contains a glossary, if needed
And ensures report credibility.



 
Defining Communication Styles
The Project Management Institute (PMI) encourages using assessments to determine personal 
communication styles, work styles, and individual motivations. Some common assessments include 
Meyers-Briggs, Insights, I-Speak, and Emergenetics. There are many more.
Let's look at the four Emergenetics communications styles to understand how different people 
communicate and how to use that knowledge to improve the effectiveness of our communications.
Note: Different models use different labels for each style. However, there is consistency across all 
models, which are based on the same scientific principles.
Common Communication Styles
There are four common styles of communication. The table below provides an overview of all the 
styles with communication preferences and the questions that will help you design the 
communication content.
Communication 
Style
Communication Preferences
Burning Questions
Analytical
Key Focus: Why
•	Need to have facts to 
support points made
•	Direct and to-the-point 
communications
•	Leave time for thinking 
and analysis
•	Get results and solve the 
problem
•	Do I have the pertinent 
facts?
•	What provides the most 
value?
•	Will this solution fully 
resolve the problem?
Structural
Key Focus: How
•	Ask what, when, where, 
and how questions
•	Speak in complete 
sentences/paragraphs
•	Very deliberate and clear
•	Meticulous

Key Focus: What
•	Asks questions that lead to 
other questions
•	Stop in mid-sentence, 
assuming others know
•	Use metaphors to make a 
point
•	Very abstract in speaking
•	Have I seen the 
possibilities?
•	What is the big picture?
•	How can we take this to a 
new level?

According to statistics, 6% of people have a singular preference, 58% have two preferences, 36% 
have three preferences, and less than 1% have all four styles. However, while an individual may 
have multiple styles and preferences, one style stands out.
Tips for Adapting Your Communication Style
A "one size fits all" communication style is not affected. Try to adapt your communication style to 
meet the needs of the individual you are communicating with. Here are some tips.
Communication Style
How to Plan and Manage Each Style
Analytical
•	Be brief
•	Provide executive summaries
•	Provide credible data
•	Present information logically
•	Allow time to digest
Structural
•	Provide all facts and details

•	Leave them alone to get the job done
•	No surprises
•	Allow time for questions and clarification
Conceptual
•	Allow time to brainstorm
•	Give freedom to reach the goal their way
•	Give the big picture and skip the details
•	Allow time to think outside of the box
•	Allow time to use creativity
Social
•	Allow some non-work conversation to break the ice
•	Watch your non-verbal's
•	Be sincere

Leadership Essentials

Welcome to "Leadership Essentials."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define the key attributes and skills of a good leader.
Explain the attributes of a servant leader.
And describe specific leadership competencies that can give your project an advantage.
A project has different leadership roles, such as management and leadership.
Management focuses on ways to meet project objectives.
Some ways include implementing effective processes, planning, coordinating, measuring, and 
monitoring
Leadership focuses on people.
This position includes influencing, motivating, listening, enabling, and other activities
dealing with the team.
As you have seen, a project manager plays a management role because they must be a good
leader.
The Project Management Institute, or PMI, provides a list of key traits and activities
of a successful leader.
Every project manager must develop these traits to be successful.
Let's look at the traits and activities of a successful leader.
One trait of successful leaders is that they create and maintain a vision and motivate others.
For example, a project manager must ensure a clear project goal.
In addition, the project manager must create a healthy work environment filled with 
empowerment
and skill proficiency, which motivates the team.
Another key trait of successful leadership is identifying, addressing, and solving challenges.
A project manager must be a problem solver.
For example, if the client complains about a team member, the project manager must fully
understand and assess the situation before providing a solution.
Leaders uphold levels of commitment by collaborating with team members.
For example, a project manager must facilitate collaboration between team members and steer
everyone toward a common goal.
The PMI prescribes some key interpersonal skills as traits of a successful leader, including:
emotional intelligence, decision-making, and conflict management.
Let's review these traits.
Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is a leadership trait that increases social awareness, improves
social skills, aids in self-improvement, and increases empathy.
For example, a project manager with high emotional intelligence acts after a thoughtful situation
assessment.
This behaviour makes it easy for the project manager to establish trust and build better relationships 
with the team and stakeholders.
Decision-making is a crucial leadership trait.
A leader must clearly define their decisions and plans and include the team in decision-making.
For example, a project manager determines that the skills required to complete the project are 
unavailable in the existing team.
In this situation, the project manager asks the team for their input and may decide that training the 
current team is a good option as timelines are flexible and the option aligns with the vision of the 
larger organization.
Finally, conflict management keeps communications respectful and focused.
Leaders always encourage dialogue that will move the project forward and intervene when conflict 
turns negative.
Consider this scenario.
The project deliverable is due next Monday.
Alex needs Julia's input to complete the task to complete the deliverable.
Julia has not responded to any of Alex's messages or emails.
Alex is annoyed but continues with other tasks.
The project manager, Chris, notices this and objectively lists the tasks to complete and assigns them 
to the respective team members.
Further, Chris encourages Alex and Julia to have a conversation to sort out their differences.
Another leadership trait is the ability to tailor a leadership style.
For example, at the start of a project, the project manager may need to be a visionary to set and 
communicate the project goal to the team.
However, when working with a junior team member, the project manager may need to be directive.
Next, let's understand servant leadership.
Servant leadership allows teams to self-organize, empowering the team to make their own 
decisions.
There are three leadership behaviours specific to a servant leader.
1: Obstacle removal.
Servant leaders encourage open communication to help identify blockers or impediments.
If the team lacks resources, address the shortage immediately.
2: Diversion shield.
Servant leaders protect the project team from internal and external distractions to help the team 
remain productive and focused.
Interface with stakeholders who have questions so the team can focus on the job.
3: Encouragement and development opportunities. Servant leaders provide tools, rewards, and
encouragement to maintain team satisfaction and productivity.
The project manager must never take the team for granted.
A leader must possess at least some competencies.
These competencies include:
Transparency.
A project manager must be transparent in their actions and thought processes.
Integrity.
A project manager must be ethical and honest.
The project manager must always share accurate and timely information.

Expert Viewpoints: Why Leadership?

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Why Leadership?
In this video, we will hear leaders and experts discuss the benefits of good leadership.
What are the benefits of good leadership?
I think one of the big benefits of good leadership is increased productivity.
You see increased productivity when you set goals, when you set clear expectations,
and when you give feedback--and you give valid feedback that's constructive and to the point,
it's not overly critical and not personal.
So, by providing clear expectations and the goals of what needs to get done,
you're really setting your team up for success.
You're enabling them to be as efficient as possible
to get things done in a possibly faster timeline than what you originally anticipated.
and that's going to produce better outcomes for your organization.
The other good thing, the other benefit of good leadership, is improved morale.
So, the clearer you are, the more concise you are, the more open you are
about what your expectations are as a leader and as a leader of team members,
the higher the morale is going to be.
there's not going to be surprises when you have feedback that they may need to change something,
and the feedback would be given in good faith.
And so, the more open you are, the more honest you are,
and the more you set expectations about what's good, better, best,
the higher the morale in your company and your organization is going to be.
And then a third one is those two combined, so:
Setting expectations, being clear about that, leading to better productivity, increased morale
You're also just going to be able to build better relationships.
Trust is something that you have to earn,
and so by being open, by being clear about what your expectations are,
you're gonna start building trust within your project team,
and then your client is going to see that as well, because you'll have a happy team,
a happy team is going to produce great results,
and then that's going to give you a happy client.
I think that the benefits of great leadership, particularly in project management, are
high performing teams and projects that are completed successfully.
So, a successful project being a project that's completed
on time, on budget, and with high-quality deliverables,
where it meets the project objectives,
and I think that great leadership does this because
great leaders are able to really bring people together in a way that
just enhances the strengths of each of the members on the team and minimizes
the weaknesses of members on the team.
Great leaders help the whole team be greater than the sum of its individual parts,
and they're able to bring out the best in people
and help teams communicate effectively about challenges and issues that they're facing
or work that needs to be done.
And that is one of the benefits of great leadership-- and, I think, those high performing teams.
As well as a leader's, a great leader's, ability to really manage stakeholders well,
to have a high overarching view of an entire project
while also being able to really understand and see the details,
helps teams get projects done on time, on budget, and in a high quality way
and really meet the project objectives in a way that makes the project successful.
In my opinion, the number one benefit of effective leadership
is the ability to motivate the team.
As a leader, you need to understand that intrinsic motivation
must come from within or inside the individual.
Successful leadership allows all stakeholders and team members
to believe they will achieve something of value by being part of the project.
It allows the individual to feel positively challenged,
believe in the work that they are doing, and strive to make a difference.
It allows for self direction,
acceptance of responsibility, and personal growth.
Question 2, what distinguishes a good leader from a poor leader?
In a word, focus.
A good--let me say, great leader,
focuses on the needs and success of others over self.
The great leader identifies and removes obstacles to success
before they impact the project and the individual.
They eliminate factors that may prevent the individual
from successfully accomplishing the work of the project.
And finally, they provide encouragement and opportunities for each member of the team
to develop their skills and ultimately thrive.
Benefits of good leadership can add value to a team's communication, productivity,
and create a better and more motivating work environment.

Expert Viewpoints: Leading Successfully

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Leading Successfully.
In this video, experts and leaders will describe
how effective leadership supported their success when managing projects.
Provide examples of effective leadership that allowed you to succeed in projects.
Well, a key aspect of effective leadership, and arguably the most
important, is to create a vision for the project that the team can embrace.
To do so, you need to both understand the purpose
of the project and be able to relay that purpose to the team.
When the team understands the purpose and buys into the value,
then they are willing to commit their time and energy in the right direction.
I recall a project for a large technology company that was
intended to upgrade numerous aspects of the company's Wide Area Network.
There were multiple stakeholders,
and each had their own understanding of what the project would deliver.
I was asked to be the program manager.
I gathered the key stakeholders together, and we had a 2-hour brainstorming session where
we collaboratively defined the project's purpose, how we would measure success,
how the future state would compare to the current state,
and finally, how we will ensure we do not drift from that vision.
In the end, we were all finally on the same page.
Expectations were established that were motivational and provided a
road map to the ultimate project success.
Some examples of things about me that I think make me an effective leader.
One, I'm very approachable.
I work to make people, try to make people, comfortable in whatever setting we're in,
whether it's on the phone, whether it's in email, or face-to-face in a meeting.
Eye contact is critical.
And if you're not, don't have your video on, then don't multitask.
So, to me, eye contact when you're in a meeting or when you're on a video call,
really crucial to show that you're engaged, that you're listening,
that you're paying attention, that you're processing what's being shared with you.
If you don't have your video on and you're not in face-to-face, then do not multitask
because you will get distracted, you will get sidetracked, so tips there on being a good leader.
In addition to that, ask questions.
You know, don't be afraid if you don't understand something,
or if you want to hear more about something, use the phrase "Tell me more."
"Tell me more" is also especially effective in calming a situation down.
If you feel like things are starting to get hot and percolate a little bit, start asking
"Can you tell me more about this? Tell me more about that."
"Tell me what happened when X, Y, and Z happened."
So, ask questions.
Make yourself available.
Listen, don't multitask.
I think those are all great characteristics and great things that leaders have.

Impact of a Good Leader on Team Dynamics 
and Productivity

Welcome to "Impact of a Good Leader on Team Dynamics and Productivity."
After watching this video, you will be able to: Summarize the Tuckman ladder.
And define how being a good project leader impacts a project team.
The dynamics of a project team vary over the project lifecycle.
For example, when team members meet for the first time, the trust levels may be minimal.
Trust may grow as the project progresses.
Conflicts may arise due to differences of opinion as the team starts working together.
All these can impact overall productivity.
A project manager must recognize, prepare, and manage the dynamics of a team throughout the 
project lifecycle, ultimately geared towards creating a high-productivity team.
The Tuckman ladder, developed by Bruce Tuckman in 1965, is a model for project team 
development throughout the project lifecycle.
The Tuckman ladder guides the project manager and prescribes leadership strategies
to achieve maximum team productivity.
The Tuckman ladder shares four stages of team development, including:
form, storm, norm, and perform.
At each stage, the Tuckman model prescribes distinct leadership strategies.
Let's look at each stage and practical leadership strategies in detail.
Consider this scenario. At the start of a new project,
individuals from different departments come together to work on the project.
Being a new project, some individuals are excited, some are confused, and others are curious.
This is the form stage of the Tuckman ladder, where the team needs general information on 
the project, such as purpose, value to the organization/themselves, and who's involved.
The project manager should be a leader who directs and tells the team what they need to know.
For example, the project manager must set clear goals and objectives, address questions and issues, 
and orient the team to the project.
Remember, failure to "tell" leads to confusion, lack of commitment, questions, and blockers.
The storm stage is when individuals start working on the project on their tasks.
For example, after the project manager provides project details to the team, each individual 
starts working on project tasks.
Different working styles can lead to conflicts and questioning each other's capabilities and working 
styles.
There may even be some [resistance] to starting any work.
This is an essential stage, as many teams fail beyond recovery.
In the storm stage, the project manager must be a leader who can "sell"
the project value to a team member and spell out the value the team member brings.
The project manager must address reservations, provide assurances, and answer questions.
Most importantly, the project manager must look for opportunities to build relationships with 
team members.
A failure to "sell" will leave the team member in a state where they are not productive and unable to 
focus on the project's work.
Next comes the norm stage, where the team has overcome the storm, they are beginning to work 
together, and their focus shifts from self to the project.
For example, individuals gradually start resolving their differences, appreciating each other's 
strengths and skills, and working as a team.
In the norm stage, the project manager must be a leader who "participates."
The project manager must encourage team members to take responsibility for the project's progress.
The project manager must also promote collaboration and effective interpersonal communication.
A failure to "participate" can lead to the team rolling back to the storm stage.
Throughout this time, the team is motivated and starts working towards a common goal.
For example, if a team member is on leave, another team member picks up the work and takes it to 
closure.
This is the perform stage of the Tuckman ladder, where the team shows commitment and motivation 
and requires minimal support.
In the perform stage, the project manager must be a leader who "delegates."
The project manager must delegate tasks to team members and let the team take responsibility.
The project manager should focus on status updates and check-ins regularly.
A failure to "delegate" displays a lack of trust and confidence in the team.
Micromanagement and team demotivation go together.

In this video, you learned that: The Tuckman Ladder is a team-building model.
There are four stages of the Tuckman Ladder: In this video, you learned that: The Tuckman Ladder 
is a team-building model.
There are four stages of the Tuckman Ladder:
Form stage, where a project manager must be a leader who "directs."
Storm stage, where a project manager must be a leader who "sells" project value.
Norm stage, where a project manager must be a leader who "participates."
Perform stage, where a project manager must be a leader who "delegates."

 
Techniques for Improving Leadership Skills

Leadership Factors and Styles

Welcome to "Leadership Factors and Styles."
After watching this video,
you'll be able to: Compare manager and leader.
Identify the different types of leadership styles.
List the factors that impact a leader's style.
And describe the Hershey Blanchard situational leadership model.
Manager and leader, as terms, are used interchangeably.
However, while managers and leaders share common attributes, there are several differences.
Project Management Institute (PMI) lists eleven distinctions between managers and leaders.
Let's look at these.


A manager uses their position to direct the work; a leader guides, influences, and collaborates using 
relational power.
A manager maintains the current state; a leader develops a new and improved state.
A manager is an administrator; a leader is an innovator.
Managers focus on systems and structures; leaders focus on relationships with people.
Managers rely on control; Leaders inspire trust.
A manager focuses on achieving short-term goals: a leader focuses on a long-range vision.
The manager asks how and when; the leader asks what and why.
Managers focus on the bottom line; leaders focus on the horizon.
Managers accept the status quo; leaders challenge the status quo.
Managers do things right; leaders do the right things.
Managers focus on operational issues and problem-solving.
Leaders focus on vision, alignment, motivation, and inspiration.
A project manager needs to strive to be both a manager and a leader.


Let's now move the focus to leadership styles and look at some distinct styles.
Laissez-Faire, or "hands-off" style, is where a leader allows the team members to work 
independently and make decisions on their own.
Transactional is a leadership style focused on accomplishments, such as completing tasks, providing 
feedback, meeting goals and objectives, and determining the rewards based on accomplishments.
Another leadership style is servant leadership.
A servant leader focuses on serving the people and always puts their people first.
Transformational leadership style focuses on empowering, inspiring, and encouraging innovation.
Charismatic leadership is a style where leaders are high energy, enthusiastic, inspirational, and have 
a strong conviction.
Interactional leadership style is a combination of transactional, transformational, and charismatic 
leadership styles.
A project manager may have one of the above leadership styles to be dominant.
However, they will need to mix or swap styles based on different situations.
One approach to select the best leadership style is influenced by the four factors.
Project manager characteristics, which include their attitude, moods, needs, values, and ethics.
Team member characteristics are their attitudes, moods, needs, values, and ethics.
Organizational characteristics, which includes the purpose and structure of the organization.
The nature of work also influences the leadership style.
Environmental characteristics, such as the current social situation, economic state,
and even internal and external political elements, can influence leadership style.
Another approach to selecting a leadership style is the Hershey Blanchard situational leadership 
model.
The model defines four specific performance-readiness levels for each team member or stakeholder.
The model suggests that project managers adapt their leadership styles to tasks and relationships in 
the workplace that map to the individual's or team member's readiness level.
Readiness Level 4 is the highest state of readiness.
The team member is highly skilled and capable of performing at a high level.
They also have the confidence to do what is required and are self-directed to take the initiative 
without being directed.
At this level, the optimal strategy is to delegate.
Readiness Level 3 is similar to Readiness Level 4 with one big exception.
The team member has the necessary skills to perform at a high level.
They also require minimal direction.
The exception is confidence:
Something's preventing this team member from taking the initiative to perform.
We classify Readiness Level 3 as a state of moderate readiness.
At this level, the optimal strategy is to participate.
Readiness Level 2 is a state where the team member has the confidence and motivation to perform;
they are anxious to move forward.
The problem is that they lack the skills to be successful.
We also classify Readiness Level 2 as a state of moderate readiness.
These team members must be leader directed; at this level, the optimal strategy is to sell.
Readiness Level 1 is the lowest state of readiness.
The team member lacks the skills necessary to perform.
In addition, they lack the confidence needed to be self-directed.
These team members must be leader directed.
At this level, the optimal strategy is to tell.
The table summarizes the association between leadership styles and readiness levels.


In this video, you learned that:
Management and leadership do intersect and have shared attributes.
There are eleven distinctions between a manager and a leader, as defined by PMI.
Some leadership styles include Laissez-Fair, transactional, transformational, servant leadership,
charismatic, and interactional.
There are four main characteristics to consider when choosing a leadership style
including leader characteristics, team characteristics, organizational characteristics, and 
environmental characteristics.
The Hershey Blanchard situational leadership model defines four specific performance readiness 
levels for each team member or stakeholder.


Expert Viewpoints: Leadership Competencies, 
Skills, and Mindset


Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Leadership Competencies, Skills, and Mindset.
What are some leadership challenges you encountered, and how did you overcome them?
I've encountered a lot of leadership challenges over the years, having been a leader and then 
obviously having been led by many leaders.
I've got to see it from both sides of the coin. I'm delivering, you know, leadership skills to
other people and then being the recipient of other people's leadership abilities and skills.
So, I've had many, many challenges.
I think if I were to kind of call out, one of the biggest challenges that I've had to face as a leader and 
then overcome is the ability to be honest with bad news.
Early on in my career, I hated delivering bad news, absolutely hated it.
Whether it be performance challenges or telling upper management that a project was going to be 
late, it didn't matter.
I just hated delivering bad news, and I don't think most people like delivering bad news.
But in leadership, in project management, it's always something that you have to do.
Things rarely go perfectly, and there's always some bad news that you have to deliver.
So, earlier on in my career, I would find ways either to avoid delivering the bad news.
I would try to solve certain problems myself so that I didn't have to deliver the bad news, or I 
would try to couch the bad news in vocabulary that made it, didn't make it sound as bad as it was.
So, one big mistake I made a lot in my career is that I wasn't clear on what I wanted my team to do 
or what I wanted a specific team member to do, or I wasn't clear to upper management on how bad 
things were because I was trying to, I was trying to minimize the impact of my bad news that I was 
delivering.
And I can say, obviously, recollection isn't always perfect, but I can say with a lot of confidence 
that in almost every situation where I did that, I ended up regretting it.
Here's an example.
When I was, you know, managing teams early in my career, there was always people on the team 
that needed to have their performance improved.
They needed to do a better job than they were doing, and we would give year end and mid year 
reviews, and I would have to tell them, you're not performing at the level you need to perform to 
get a good bonus or whatever, and I would not want to deliver that message because people never 
wanted to hear that they weren't performing well.
And so I would try to, I would couch it, I would focus on the things they were doing well, and then 
I would say, oh, and here's a couple of things you should probably work on.
But I was never really super clear on, you know, you're not performing, and these are the things that 
you need to get better at in order to get up to that top performer level, and then six months later, or a 
year later, whenever the next review was, they didn't really--so, at their next performance review,
they didn't really respond to the feedback I gave them because I wasn't clear in my feedback,
and their situation would be worse, and then I'd have to deliver even more bad news.
But I didn't want to deliver the worse news the six months or a year later.
And so that problem would continue to exacerbate until it came up, it came to a really big problem 
that my manager would have to step in and deliver the bad news.
So, I had to learn to be an effective leader.
It's better to deliver hard news and sometimes bad news very, very honestly, and very clearly 
upfront rather than letting it, you know, just grow bigger and bigger until a project blows up. Now 
obviously, there's ways to deliver bad news or tough news in a way that doesn't demoralize the 
people that you're delivering it to or that doesn't, you know, that reduces confidence in leadership if 
you have to deliver bad news to leadership.
But I have found that being extremely clear and not soft soaping your bad messages, and then 
always trying to provide a mitigation--
So, if you have to deliver a bad message to one of your, the people on your team, you can say 
"Here's what's happening; here's what it means if you don't improve."
"But now let's talk about ways that we can turn this around."
Or if you have a project that is behind schedule, you can say to your team that the project is behind 
schedule, things aren't going well.
Here's the impact if we don't turn this around, and here are some ideas that I'm going to bring to 
the table to help us get this back on track.
So it's not just delivering bad news and kind of letting the team flounder.
It's providing a path forward so that that can be improved, and then the team has a very good sense 
of what they need to do, or the individual you're talking to has a good sense of what they need to do
in order to get the project or their career or whatever it is back on track.
So, I think those two components go together.
For a large number of years, I've been a remote worker and so I--even when people were in the 
office before COVID--I was not there.
You know, people would, project team members would have hallway conversations, they would 
discuss something, maybe they'd decide something.
Maybe they would take the project a different way and I'm not there to be part of that conversation.
Not every conversation can be had in a meeting with a remote person as part of that meeting
or be documented as notes and sent out later.
You're not going to get people who run into each other in your little kitchen area at work, getting a 
cup of coffee, having a conversation, they're not going to go back to their desk and ping you and 
say, "hey, I just talked to this person, and here's what we talked about, and I thought you should 
know."
So what I've done, what I did to overcome that, what I still do, is I just have frequent touch points,
almost like a Sprint, in order to stay informed.
And so maybe it's a 15-minute connect at the end of the day or noon or whatever.
Maybe it's a coffee chat in the morning, but I just touch base with key people that I have a really 
good relationship with and say, hey, what's going on?
Who have you talked to lately?
Anything I need to know about that you're hearing around the office? Or wherever they are,
you know, and around--I think of "around the office" as in air quotes.
That has really been one of the critical things that I've done to to work past being a remote leader to 
where I can't be there.
The other issue or the other leadership challenge that I have faced in the last few years is having a 
global team And my team, I'm in Fargo, North Dakota, and my team is in India.
I cannot be feet on the ground for them.
I can't be there to react in the moment to provide decisional direction on hot items.
And so again, frequent connections, frequent conversations, and then also different chat apps, 
WhatsApp on my cell phone if they need to get a hold of me, or texts or something like that.
They are really critical.
And then then surrounding myself with people that I trust.
That's really a big one, and there's probably different quotes of people saying that.
I think Presidents have said that, US Presidents, but, where I can't be feet on the ground, where I 
can't be available for crucial in-the-moment conversations, I need to trust the person who is having 
that conversation. And I do.
And my team in India is an excellent team and they run a really tight ship.
And so finding those trusted people that you can have on your team that keep you informed, that 
engage you when you need to be engaged, is super critical.
I am a firm believer in the Emotional Intelligence model.
Unfortunately, I often encounter many stakeholders who have severe self-awareness issues.
They have no idea how their actions impact the team.
In addition, they have limited control over how the team affects them.
I often share the top five self-awareness challenges and ask the team members to honestly evaluate 
themselves.
If they are lacking, I give them a challenge to address the challenge they see as the biggest one 
impacting them.
So let me go ahead and include the top five areas of self-awareness challenges you may encounter.
Challenge number 1.
Do you accurately perceive your own emotions in the moment and understand your tendencies 
across situations?
Do you know how you're going to react?
Number 2.
Are you willing to tolerate the discomfort of focusing on feelings that are negative?
Unfortunately, in project management, not everything is positive, and sometimes, you have to have 
the difficult discussions.
Number 3 is my favourite:
Do you have a straightforward and honest understanding of why you do the things you do?
Do you know how people push your buttons and how you're going to react?
Do you have a clear understanding of what you do well, what motivates and satisfies you,
and again, which people or situations can lead you into actions that perhaps, you may not be happy 
with in retrospect?
Finally, are you afraid of your emotional mistakes?
Or can you recognize the beauty and the blemishes of who you are?
I'm going to take this as the approach of other managers that I've worked with and my own 
leadership as far as things that we had encountered.
So, for example, the first one is lack of communication.
When you don't understand exactly how they like to communicate and they don't look to see how 
you would like to communicate, there's that barrier.
With open communication, you also understand more of the expectations that they're looking for.
When you have no expectations, it can be a very stressful environment--for both sides,
because you're not getting the information you need from your manager, and the manager doesn't 
know what's going on either.
So, really having that open communication, setting expectations, makes a huge difference.

Situational Leadership with Your Team

Welcome to "Situational Leadership with Your Team."
After watching this video, you'll be able to:
Summarize key leadership tailoring considerations
Explain the OSCAR coaching and mentoring model.
There are different types of leadership styles, including tell, sell, participate, and delegate.
Another video explains the leadership styles in detail.
The project manager cannot rely on one or the other and must be able to determine the most 
appropriate leadership style based on the situation.
For example: A project manager has to manage the completion of a project.
The team has been working together for a long time and understands the project processes
and deliverables.
The project manager has full confidence in them.
Therefore, they can use the "delegate" leadership style with the team.
A project manager must understand how to tailor the leadership style in different scenarios.
To help the project manager with tailoring or adapting the leadership styles, the Project 
Management Institute, or PMI, provides four key variables.
Let's dive into the variables.
One variable to consider is the team member's expertise.
A project manager must determine the level of expertise each team member possesses.
The project manager must also determine how well a team member's skill-set matches the project's 
requirements.
A good understanding of the skill levels and capability to perform the required tasks in a project is 
crucial to select the proper leadership style.
For example, consider a team member with minimal skills and low confidence.
In this case, a project manager needs to provide direction.
Hence the project manager will use the "direct" leadership style.
An example of selling is encouraging the team member to apply new skills learned in a training 
session.
Another variable to consider is the maturity of team members.
While a team member may have the expertise in a certain skill, experience working in the area of 
expertise can bring other advanced skills, such as problem-solving, adaptability, and resilience.
The third variable to consider when selecting the appropriate leadership style in a given 
situation is governance.
The level of governance drives the levels of empowerment and delegation that a project 
manager can give the team.
For example, on a highly data-sensitive project, the project manager may need to direct all team 
members to work from an onsite location rather than a remote location.
The project manager might even need to use the "sell" leadership style to help team members 
understand the importance of the project for the organization while highlighting the skill 
additions for the team members.
The fourth variable to be considered when selecting the leadership style is the nature of the 
team setup: co-located or distributed.
For example, consider a team of experienced individuals that works in from the same location.
It's likely to be easy for a project manager to assess the team's maturity and delegate work as 
necessary.
At the same time, in a newly set up distributed environment, irrespective of the levels of expertise 
in the team, the project may need to use "direct" leadership style until the team settles.
With an understanding of the variables in leadership styles, a project manager can use the OSCAR 
coaching and mentoring model.
Developed by Karen Whitworth and Andrew Gilbert, the OSCAR model is a five-step process 
to help leaders better adapt their styles and approaches by providing an action plan for 
personal development.
The OSCAR model refers to five contributing factors.
The Outcome can be summarized as the expectations you have for the individual in the long run.
What is the expected result from the conversation?
The Situation is, in essence, a gap analysis.
Where is the individual in terms of skills, abilities, and knowledge, and where do they need to be?
Choices and consequences objectively analyse the gaps and determine the best way to improve the 
individual's performance and outcomes.
The Action is a well-planned step-by-step approach to reach the level of success required of the 
individual.
Finally, Reviews at each step along the way are essential to provide feedback and ensure the 
individual stays on track.
Let's review an example of using the OSCAR model. Consider a scenario:
A new developer has been assigned to the project team.
One: the project manager defines the outcomes.
The outcome is that the new team member must integrate into the team and be self-directed 
by the next iteration.
Next, the project manager defines the situation and performs a gap analysis.
The situation with gap analysis is:
The new team member is deficient in three key skills and must attend a training class.
The consequence is explained in terms of choices.
In this example, the new team member must score at least an 80% on the final training course exam
and be evaluated by a senior team member for competence.
The action plan is developed, and the new team member signs off.
In the end, the team member's progress is reviewed and ready for being self-directed.

In this video, you learned that:
The Project Management Institute, or PMI, has four key variables
when determining the most appropriate leadership style:
experience, maturity, governance, and distributed teams.
Developed by Karen Whitworth and Andrew Gilbert, the OSCAR model is a five-step process
to help leaders better adapt their styles and approaches by providing an action plan for 
personal development.


 
Mapping Situational Leadership Model to the 
Tuckman Ladder

Hershey Blanchard Situational Leadership Model: Review
Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard created the Situational leadership(r) model in the 1970s.
The model defines four specific readiness performance readiness levels for each team member or 
stakeholder.The model suggests that project managers adapt their leadership style to tasks and 
relationships in the workplace that map to the individual's or team member's readiness level.
Readiness level R4 indicates that the team member is self-directed. They are able, confident, and 
willing to perform at a high level.
At R3, the team member is still self-directed. However, they are insecure or unwilling to perform.
An R2 team member requires leadership direction. They are unable to perform their assigned tasks. 
However, the team member is confident, willing to learn, and ready to try.
At R1, the team member also requires leadership direction. They cannot perform their assigned 
tasks and are insecure or unwilling to learn and try.
The table summarizes how the different levels map with the strategies.

advise. Manage dysfunctional conflict. Coach the team to build their skills while maintaining 
motivational levels.
R3: The team still needs relational support. Stop telling and selling. Empower the team to work 
together to accomplish the goals of the project. Continue to build trust within the group. Be 
accessible and provide support as needed. Avoid the tendency to micromanage.
R4: Let the team manage conflicts and plan the work internally. Stay out of the way. Check-in with 
the group occasionally to ensure everything is tracking as planned. Periodically provide rewards and 
recognitions to maintain high motivational levels.
Conclusion
Team members will be in different stages of development. As a project manager, treat each team 
member individually. Determine where they are on the ladder and apply situational leadership 
accordingly.

 
The Knowledge Sharing Hierarchy
A key project management responsibility is effective knowledge management. Knowledge 
management can ensure critical information is distributed to all stakeholders promptly and also 
facilitate efficient and effective project planning and execution.
Objective
•	Define work performance data (WPD), work performance information (WPI), and 
work performance reports (WPR)
•	Apply the knowledge-sharing hierarchy to project management leadership
•	Revisit the importance of Lessons Learned
Introduction to Knowledge Sharing Hierarchy
The Project Management Institute (PMI) categorizes data and information into three 
categories. The illustration shares the knowledge-sharing hierarchy.
 
 
Work performance data (WPD) is "raw" observations and measurements identified during 
activities to carry out the project work. WPD is commonly acquired from conversations, emails, 
or routine project correspondence. Typically, WPD has limited value. However, WPD needs to 
be received, acknowledged and understood. Occasionally, WPD contains information critical to 
project success. WPD is received during the executing process group. WPD can take the form of an 
e-mail from a team member expressing reservations about a milestone. It may be a customer 
conversation where they share ideas to save resource dollars. Or as simple as a user stating they 
want to ensure instructions on how to use a new product are easy to understand.
Work performance information (WPI) is derived from WPD. WPI is performance data collected 
during the monitoring and controlling process group. WPI usually is more consequential than 
WPD. Examples include the status of deliverables, implementation status, and forecast estimates to 
complete. WPI is analyzed to develop work performance reports (WPR).
WPRs are distributed during the monitoring and controlling process groups. WPR extracts 
critical WPI data and shares information to generate decisions, raise issues, report status, 
request assistance, or address problems and solutions.
Applying the Knowledge-Sharing Hierarchy to Project 
Management Leadership
The effective use of WPRs can aid the team and stakeholders in two areas essential to leadership 
success. The team's readiness to perform at a high level is tied to their understanding, abilities, 
confidence, and motivation.
Actively listening to the team and processing WPD presents an impression that the project manager 
is concerned and receptive to the team's inputs, which builds trust and increases motivation and 
commitment.
Working closely with the team to identify WPI required to share and distribute details in the 
WPR provides critical task-related details that can increase team effectiveness. In addition, the 
knowledge-sharing hierarchy can be used to share essential project benefits and values to increase 
commitment, confidence, and willingness to support the project.
Importance of Lessons Learned in Knowledge Sharing
Lessons learned are one of the greatest sources of knowledge for a project manager. Optimally 
lessons learned are accomplished at the completion of each project phase and at the end of the 
project. Discussions during lessons learned provide a wealth of WPD that, in many cases, can 
be used to identify consequential WPI. This new WPI can then be used to provide critical 
knowledge in WPR.
Lessons learned address three key questions.
 What went well in a project,
what could have gone better,
and what can be improved the next time?
Lessons learned address vital skills and task-related information that can improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the team on the next project. In addition, lessons learned share 
key risks, issues that were addressed and overcome, and discovered opportunities.
Lessons learned have little impact on the current project. However, they can assist all organization 
project managers by providing information to help better lead future projects.

 
Intuitive Decision-Making
One of the challenges for a project manager is making decisions that can significantly impact the 
success or failure of the project. While data and analysis help a project manager make informed 
decisions, there are times when the project manager may need to rely on intuition to make 
decisions because not enough data is available.
In today's business landscape, where it may not be easy to meet with team members and 
stakeholders in person, trusting one's intuition can be invaluable.
Objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:
•	Describe the need for intuitive decision-making when managing projects
•	Explain how to use four types of thought patterns to validate decisions made based on one's 
intuition
Need for Intuitive Decision-Making
Sometimes in high-pressure or time-dependent situations, a project manager doesn't have enough 
time to analyse all available data. Yet, when a project manager must make an immediate decision, 
the project manager must make decisions based on their intuition. A project manager relies on 
things like their past experiences and emotional intelligence. In part, emotional intelligence is 
the ability to interpret the emotions of others effectively. Sometimes, it is necessary to gauge 
others' feelings and incorporate that understanding into the decision-making process. Also, a 
project manager may need to depend on their emotions, which are automated reactions based 
on experience, because otherwise, the project manager doesn't have enough explicit 
information. Learn to trust your intuitive reaction.
A project manager may have to make quick decisions to reduce the impact of various issues on the 
project. In these situations, relying on one's instincts can help make quick decisions that can be 
critical to the success of the situation. The more knowledge and experience a project manager 
has, the more the intuitive instincts come from sound reasoning and informed decision-
making.
To help a project manager feel comfortable with their intuition-based decisions, knowing one's 
thinking patterns and preferences can be helpful. What kind of evidence do you need to trust your 
intuition?
Ned Hermann's whole brain model
According to Ned Hermann's whole brain model, there are four categories of thought patterns: 
analytical, practical, relational, and experimental. Knowing your thought patterns when making 
decisions will help you trust your judgment when relying on your intuition.
If an individual is an analytical thinker, they will feel most comfortable taking a logical approach 
to decision-making. Ask yourself such questions as, "What factors will indicate the solution is on 
track?" "What are the possible root causes of the problem?" "What aspects indicate a need for 
change?" and "Are those indicators subjective or objective?"
If an individual is a practical thinker, their thinking is organized, detailed, and structured. 
They focus on a method to solve a problem. Practical thinkers feel most comfortable following a 
plan in problem-solving and avoiding pitfalls. They effectively manage their feelings when making 
decisions to ensure the actions are focused.
Relational thinkers will trust their intuition when solving problems by getting a sense of the 
problem through the eyes of the people the issue affects the most. They carefully gauge choices and 
decisions by listening to the tone of interactions and reactions of the people involved.
Finally, experimental thinkers will trust their intuition when making innovative and creative 
choices. They like to understand how their decisions affect the big picture. They prefer to explore 
and consider possibilities before making a choice. A project manager will also find times when 
they must trust someone else's intuition. Understanding their thought pattern preferences according 
to the whole brain model may also help you evaluate their decisions when you have little else to go 
on.
A project manager must assess the potential risks and benefits of the decision based on the 
thought patterns as a basis for evaluation. A project manager must ask questions, express 
concerns, and try to understand others' perspectives. If their thought pattern preference is 
different, it may be helpful to justify their decision by asking them questions based on one's 
preferred thought pattern category.
Conclusion
The need for decision-making based on intuition arises in time-dependent situations when 
there is not enough time to gather all the relevant data. It is helpful to understand the four 
categories of thought patterns when justifying intuitive decisions. The categories include analytical, 
practical, relational, and experimental thinking.


Expert Viewpoints: Using your Intuition

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Using your Intuition.
In this video, we will hear from leaders and experts discussing the importance of using
your intuition to make decisions and share their real-world experiences.
When a project goes off course, there are tiny little hints that many people might not
notice, but a good project manager will pick up on it right away.
Maybe it's silence on a call.
Maybe it's a client's communication style that has shifted, and their sentences are a little bit shorter 
with a small hint of negativity.
It's important to not shy away from this and start checking in with your teammates and clients one-
on-one.
"Say, hey, how are you feeling about this project?
I've noticed this ___."
This will help you get to the root of the problem faster and change course.

Intuition, for me, is the ability to use your background knowledge, your natural skills, as well as all 
the training and experience that you've gained to bring that to the
table to help make decisions.  So, for example, if you're presented with a problem, let's say that a 
stakeholder has just told you that they thought they were going to have time to work on your 
project, but now they have to pull out because the previous project that they were working on
is running over.
Now, without intuition, you may not have any sense of what that's going to mean, and if you're a 
junior project manager, that may seem like the world's going to end, right?
"This is now no longer something I can handle.
We have a major stakeholder that can't do their work and so we need to push out the timelines and 
all the rest of it," right?
If you have some intuitions around that, you may say, "OK.
This has happened before.
I've experienced this problem before.
Then there's a number of things I can do.
I can go to the person's manager and ask for that person's time back or see if the manager has 
another person on their team that can step in and fill in the gap."
There's things that you can do to maybe share time so the person works a little bit on the previous 
project and then works on your project.
You may even evaluate, "Do I need this stakeholder?
Is this something that I can do without for at least the time being.
Or can I push the stakeholder out so they can join later and then still not impact the project 
timelines?"
So, what I think intuition does there is it gives you a sense of 'What does this information
that I've just received, what does it mean for this project?
And how do I incorporate that information now to make a good decision or to make a decision 
that's right for the team or a decision that is going to help ensure that this project continues to move 
forward?"
And intuitions can help with that because they do bring that past experience to the table as well as 
kind of your natural dispositions for dealing with complicated issues in a project.
And every project has those complicated issues for sure.
I think part of the problem with intuition is that it is very... It can be very difficult to define, and 
understanding what your own intuitions, what you're good at intuitively, and what you actually 
need data for can also be very tricky.
So, for example, a project manager might think that they have some really good intuitions
on how long something is going to take to accomplish, whereas you know most people need
a little bit of data.
So, if you're developing a product and there's a certain aspect of that product that is critical for 
getting the project done, having some data so that you say in the past this has taken developers this 
much time to put this piece of the project together.
I'm going to use that information and then add my intuition on top of that.
I think you can use data and then add intuition to that data to make better decisions.
If you if you just use data.
If you say it's taken this long in the past and it's going to take this long for this project without 
bringing your intuitions to the table, I think you miss and miss out on something very critical there.
I think you miss out on a very important aspect of using raw data without intuition, that adding 
intuition to that data can definitely help you make better decisions.

Intuition can be very useful when you're in situations where there's incomplete information,
ambiguity, maybe a crisis situation, or you just need to make a decision really fast in the moment.
Trusting your gut, going with what you think is right in that moment in time, is very acceptable
in my book.
But always going with your gut and not looking for data, facts, and taking the time to analyse it and 
really make an informed decision is not the right way to go.
You really need to balance out, as a successful leader, your gut decisions together with your
very well-informed decisions.
Of course, you want to lean towards the side of a well-informed decision.
But in those moments when you need to make it a gut decision or use your intuition to make a 
decision when you don't have the complete facts, feel empowered to do that.
The more you do, you will get more competent in the outcome and in making those decisions,
but early on, I know it is tough to to feel confident that you can take a chance and go with it.
I think as long as you're trying your best in my book and you're making the decision, or you're 
using your intuition and making your gut decision based on the best of your abilities, I'm not going 
to fault anybody for that.
There may be some people who do, but in my book, you're trying your best and trying to keep 
things moving forward.


 
Module 4 Summary: Leadership 
Fundamentals
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know that:
•	Management focuses on meeting project objectives, while leadership focuses on people. 
Some key leader traits and activities include vision and motivation, problem-solving, 
commitment and collaboration, interpersonal skills, including emotional intelligence, 
decision-making, and conflict management, and the ability to tailor leadership style. Servant 
leadership behaviors include obstacle removal, being a diversion encouraging, and 
developing team member skills. Leader competencies include transparency, integrity, 
respect, positive discourse, support, courage, and celebrate success.
•	The Tuckman Ladder is a team-building model with four stages including:
•	Form stage, where a project manager must be a leader who "directs."
•	Storm stage, where a project manager must be a leader who "sells" project value.
•	Norm stage, where a project manager must be a leader who "participates."
•	Perform stage, where a project manager must be a leader who "delegates."
•	To improve their leadership skills, project managers can apply critical thinking, increase 
emotional intelligence, improve decision-making, and enhance conflict management. As a 
leader, make sure to establish and maintaina vision, understand motivation, tailor your 
leadership style, lead by example, and be accessible.
•	There are eleven distinctions between a manager and a leader, as defined by PMI. Some 
leadership styles include Laissez-Fair, transactional, transformational, servant leadership, 
charismatic, and interactional. There are four main characteristics to consider when choosing 
a leadership style, including leader characteristics, team characteristics, organizational 
characteristics, and environmental characteristics. The Hershey Blanchard situational 
leadership model defines four specific performance readiness levels for each team member 
or stakeholder.
•	The Project Management Institute, or PMI, has four key variables when determining the 
most appropriate leadership style: experience, maturity, governance, and distributed 
teams. Developed by Karen Whitworth and Andrew Gilbert, the OSCAR model is a five-
step process to help leaders better adapt their styles and approaches by providing an action 
plan for personal development.
•	The stages in the Tuckman Ladder map perfectly with the readiness levels in the Hersey 
Blanchard situational leadership model. The project manager can determine the situational 
leadership style to implement depending on the level. Some team members will be in 
different stages of development. As a project manager, treat each team member individually. 
Determine where they are on the ladder and apply situational leadership accordingly.
•	PMI categorizes data and information into three categories, including work performance 
data (WPD) at the lowest, followed by work performance information (WPI), and finally, 
work performance. Knowledge-sharing hierarchy can be used to share essential project 
benefits and values to increase commitment, confidence, and willingness to support the 
project. Discussions during lessons learned provide a wealth of WPD that, in many cases, 
can be used to identify consequential WPI. This new WPI can then be used to provide 
critical knowledge in WPR.
•	The need for decision-making based on intuition arises in time-dependent situations when 
there is not enough time to gather all the relevant data. It is helpful to understand the four 
categories of thought patterns when justifying intuitive decisions. These categories include 
analytical, practical, relational, and experimental thinking.

Effective Resource Management

 
Effective Resource Planning
Resources are critical to a project's success. Therefore, ensuring that the right resources are 
available at the right time is critical. Further, resource planning is a critical activity in project 
management, which aids the project manager in managing resources effectively.
Objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:
•	Define resource planning
•	Explain the benefits of resource planning
•	Identify areas project managers should consider when assigning resources to tasks
What is effective resource planning?
Effective resource planning involves identifying and estimating the resources needed for a 
project, including personnel, equipment, materials, and budget. The project manager also needs 
to allocate the resources appropriately across the project's tasks and timelines to ensure effective use 
of the resources.
Effective resource planning involves identifying each deliverable for the project and creating a 
work breakdown structure (WBS) for the overall project. The WBS list all the project tasks 
sequentially to the lowest level. The WBS will help the project manager identify what and when 
resources are required to complete different tasks.
Note: Another video covers details about WBS.
Resource planning considerations
After the project manager creates the WBS, they must assign different tasks to resources. Before 
resource assignment in the resource plan, project managers must consider various considerations.
•	Availability of resources: Project managers need to ensure that resources are available 
when required. In addition, the project manager must consider team members' workload, 
equipment, and materials when assigning resources to tasks.
•	Skills and expertise: Project managers must consider the skills and expertise required to 
complete each task. For the plan to be effective, the project manager must assign resources 
with the necessary skills and training to complete the tasks.
•	Prioritization of tasks: Project managers should review and identify critical tasks and 
assign resources accordingly.
•	Interdependencies: A project manager must consider interdependencies between tasks 
when assigning resources. The project manager must assign tasks dependent on each other to 
the appropriate resources and completed in the right sequence.
•	Budget: Project managers must ensure resources assigned to tasks are within the allocated 
project budget.
What are the benefits of resource planning?
While it may seem a cumbersome process, resource planning is highly beneficial. Some benefits of 
effective resource planning include:
Better estimation of timelines and deadlines
Resource planning helps a project manager look ahead at a project's resource requirements and 
create a detailed plan for the types of resources needed, how much is required, and when each 
resource is needed. With a clear understanding of available resources and their capacities, project 
managers can better estimate project timelines and deadlines.
Better risk management
Resource planning is a proactive activity that helps project teams proactively manage risks and 
mitigate potential issues before they arise. For example, resource planning helps with a clear picture 
of resource requirements. By mapping the requirement with resource availability, project managers 
can identify potential bottlenecks or resource constraints that may impact project timelines before 
they become an issue.
Better cost management
With clear visibility of tasks, resource availability, and requirement, project managers can allocate 
resources efficiently and minimize unnecessary expenses.
Increased stakeholder satisfaction
By optimizing resource allocation and avoiding delays or cost overruns, project managers can 
demonstrate their ability to deliver high-quality results, enhancing stakeholder satisfaction.
Improved efficiency
Resource planning helps ensure the right resources are available at the right time, which can 
improve overall efficiency and productivity. In addition, it helps to avoid situations where resources 
are underutilized or overburdened.
Avoids overallocation
Overallocation occurs when a project manager assigns more work to a resource than they can 
realistically complete within a given time. With efficient resource planning, a project manager can 
avoid overallocation. Avoiding overallocation can help with:
•	Increased team morale
•	High energy and increased project involvement
•	Superior quality output
•	Reduction in delays
How to do resource planning
Project managers can use the resource breakdown structure (RBS) document to plan resources and 
avoid overallocation effectively. The Project Management Institute defines the resource breakdown 
structure as "a chart that is a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type."
Project managers create a resource breakdown structure during the planning phase of a 
project to identify all the necessary project resources, including human resources, software 
and tools, equipment, and more.
Conclusion
Resource planning is a crucial activity in project management that helps project managers 
manage resources effectively. Effective resource planning involves identifying and estimating the 
resources needed for a project and allocating them appropriately across tasks and timelines to 
ensure effective use. Project managers must consider several factors such as availability, skills, 
prioritization, interdependencies, and budget before assigning resources to tasks. Effective resource 
planning offers several benefits, including better estimation of timelines and deadlines, risk 
management, cost management, increased stakeholder satisfaction, and improved efficiency. The 
use of a resource breakdown structure document is a tool that project managers can use to plan 
resources effectively and avoid overallocation.

Acquiring Resources

Welcome to "Acquiring Resources."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Recognize the common challenges that project managers face when acquiring resources.
Explain why effective negotiation skills are important for project managers when acquiring
resources.
Identify the key principles of effective negotiation.
And describe how the key principles of effective negotiation can be applied to the challenges
of resource acquisition.
Acquiring resources needed to complete the project successfully is also a project manager's
responsibility.
However, acquiring resources can be a complex and challenging process.
Let's explore the most common challenges that project managers face when acquiring
resources.
One of the biggest challenges project managers face when acquiring resources is having a
limited budget to work with.
A limited budget can make it difficult to obtain the resources needed to complete the
project successfully.
Another common challenge is the limited availability of resources, including personnel, equipment,
or materials.
Sometimes, there may be conflicting priorities making it difficult to obtain a resource.
For example, consider a team member shared among multiple projects, making it challenging
to obtain the resource.
Lack of effective communication can lead to misunderstandings or confusion about resource
needs and availability.
The project manager can implement a few actionable resource acquisition strategies to mitigate
the challenges.
Let's look at the strategies.
Build a strong network of colleagues and potential resource providers, such as vendors, suppliers,
and subcontractors, to increase the likelihood of finding the necessary resources when they
are needed.
Build relationships with other department heads and project managers to identify potential
conflicts and proactively address them.
Ensure clear and effective communication with stakeholders and resource providers, including
concise documentation on timelines, budgets, and deliverables.
Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine which resources are critical to the project's
success and prioritize their acquisition.
While a project manager may implement one or more resource acquisition strategies, they
may still struggle to acquire the required resources.
Effective negotiation can help project managers to overcome some challenges by finding mutually
beneficial solutions that satisfy both the project's needs and the resource provider's
needs.
According to the PMBOK, negotiation is a process of communicating, collaborating, and 
compromising to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
There are six key principles to effective negotiation, including:
Be prepared.
Build relationships.
Listen actively.
Communicate clearly.
Creatively solve problems.
Manage emotions.
Let's look at each principle in detail.
Be prepared.
Before the negotiation begins, the project manager should understand the negotiation
process, identify key issues, define objectives, and aim to understand the other party's interests.
The project manager must understand if there are any competing priorities or challenges
the other party may face regarding resources.
Build relationships.
When the negotiation begins, attempt to build a relationship and trust with the other party,
which can create a positive negotiation environment.
You can do this by expressing your willingness to work with the other person and identifying
areas of common interest.
Be sure to listen actively.
Active listening lets negotiators understand the other party's interests, concerns, and
needs.
If necessary, repeat back the other party's concerns or objections, and ask questions
to clarify.
Communicate clearly and assertively to avoid misunderstandings and ensure that both parties
understand each other's needs and expectations.
Be sure to state your resourcing needs and position clearly.
Think creatively to come up with possible solutions.
Be willing to explore alternative options and make concessions when necessary.
Finally, managing your emotions and maintaining a professional demeanour throughout the 
negotiation process is important.
Negotiation can be a stressful and emotional process, but following the key principles of effective 
negotiation can help you acquire resources even if you face many challenges.

In this video, you learned that:
Project managers face budget, availability, prioritization, and communication challenges
when acquiring resources.
Project managers can mitigate these challenges by networking, building relationships, clearly
communicating, and doing cost-benefit analysis.
Effective negotiation is a process of communicating, collaborating, and compromising with 
other parties to come to a mutually beneficial solution.
Project managers can effectively negotiate by following six key principles, including
preparing for the negotiation, building rapport, actively listening during negotiations,
clearly and assertively communicating needs, creatively problem-solving with other parties,
and managing their emotions.


Building Trust




Welcome to "Building Trust."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Summarize Lencioni's 5 dysfunctions of a team.
Identify methods to build trust.
Trust is a key factor that helps the project manager, team, and stakeholders ensure the project is 
successfully delivered on time and on budget.
When a team lacks trust, part of the project manager's role is to determine reasons for the trust 
deficit.
Lencioni's five dysfunctions of a team model describes five common dysfunctions that can 
occur within a team, which can impede trust and collaboration.
The dysfunctions build upon one another.
The first or the bottom-most layer of dysfunction is the absence of trust.
When team members are unwilling to be vulnerable and open up to each other, it creates a lack of 
trust within the team.
The next layer is fear of conflict.
Healthy debate and conflict are good for a team's growth.
When team members fear voicing their opinions and ideas, it can result in poor decision-making.
The third layer is a lack of commitment.
Team members may lack motivation and commitment when they don't align with project goals and 
objectives.
The fourth layer is avoidance of accountability.
Team members may not feel accountable or responsible for the project outcomes.
This can result from a lack of commitment or motivation.
The final layer is inattention to results.
When team members prioritize their individual goals over the project goals, it can lead to a lack of 
focus on achieving the desired outcomes.
Lencioni's dysfunction model shows that the absence of trust makes up the bottom layer.
Lencioni defines trust as the confidence among team members that their peers' intentions are 
good, and that there is no reason to be protective and careful around the group.
He describes trust as the willingness of team members to be vulnerable with each other and to 
admit their weaknesses and mistakes without fear of judgment or reprisal.
In other words, team members trust each other when they feel safe enough to be open and 
honest about their thoughts, feelings, and intentions.
According to Lencioni, trust is critical because it sets the tone for the rest of the team's interactions.
Without trust, team members are more likely to avoid conflict, withhold their opinions, and 
prioritize their individual goals over the project outcomes.
Trust is essential for building strong relationships and effective collaboration, and it requires 
a commitment from all team members to be open and honest with each other.
How do you, as a project manager, help a team build trust?
Building trust is not an easy exercise.
Building trust often requires teams to spend ample time together.
It also requires team members to have a deep understanding of others' unique skills, abilities, 
and personalities.
It requires team members to fulfil their commitments and complete tasks as promised consistently.
Finally, trust is earned through a track record of honesty, transparency, and accountability.
There are also a few team exercises you can leverage to help build trust more quickly.
For example, imagine a small digital marketing agency that has just been acquired by a more 
prominent, more traditional marketing firm.
The project manager believes there's a lack of trust in the team due to different personalities, 
communication styles, focus areas, and approaches.
One way the project manager can help the team gain a deeper understanding of other team members 
to build trust is to do an exercise where team members share information about themselves.
The exercises don't need to be incredibly personal in nature but should provide some interesting or 
unique information about each member.
Some examples include Two truths and a lie:
In this game, each team member shares three statements about themselves, two of which are true 
and one that's false.
The other team members must guess which statement is the lie
Human bingo:
Create a bingo card with different personal characteristics, such as "plays an instrument,"
"has travelled to a foreign country," or "speaks more than one language."
Team members must talk to each other and find someone who fits each characteristic until they 
have a full bingo card Life-mapping: Have each team member create a short visual timeline of the 
most important, impactful events of their life and share key points with the team.
You can ask team members to keep the timeline professional in nature and focus on things like 
educational milestones, career milestones, and inflection points where they learned a new skill
or had a life-changing conversation with a mentor.
Now, imagine the new marketing team is working on a complex project with tight deadlines and 
multiple dependencies.
The team members do not communicate regularly with each other or with the project 
manager, and they avoid sharing their progress, challenges, or ideas.
They also do not give or receive constructive feedback on their work.
When the team does communicate, conversations quickly turn into heated debates.
To build trust in this scenario, a project manager may have the team take a personality 
assessment and share their results with key members of their team.
Understanding different personality types and preferences can help team members understand their 
own strengths and weaknesses and communicate more effectively with others who have different 
preferences.
A few of the most popular assessments include:
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI):
This assessment measures personality preferences based on four dichotomies:
extraversion/introversion, sensing/intuition, thinking/feeling, and judging/perceiving.
DiSC: This assessment measures behavioural styles based on four dimensions:
dominance, influence, steadiness, and conscientiousness.
Strengths Finder: This assessment measures individual strengths across 34 talent themes.
Insights and Emergenetics: Breaks out an individual's thinking attributes into four styles to 
determine work preferences, communications styles, and more.
By applying some of these strategies, the project manager of the newly created marketing team
can begin to build trust in the team.
Over time, as the team members fulfil their commitments and continue to be more transparent,
trust will continue to grow.

In this video, you learned that:
Lencioni's 5 dysfunctions of a team include: absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of 
commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results.
Trust is the confidence among team members that their peer's intentions are good
and that there's no reason to be protective and careful around the group.
Building trust is not easy, and it requires time, credibility, and an understanding of team 
members' unique attributes.
Project managers can leverage exercises such as unique attributes exercises and personality 
assessments to build trust more quickly.


Expert Viewpoints: Trusting Team 
Environment

Welcome Expert Viewpoints: Inspiring Trust within Teams.
In this video, we will hear leaders and experts describe the methods they use to inspire trust
and develop rapport with and between team members and stakeholders.
What methods do you use to inspire trust and develop rapport with and between team members and 
stakeholders?
Generally speaking, developing trust and rapport, I think happens through honesty.
By allowing yourself to be vulnerable, not coming in as I know everything, I'm going to lead this 
project, it's going to be great, but really building up a team of co ownership co responsibility, 
capitalizing on people's strengths and diminishing the effects, the effects of people's weaknesses.
Openness and be willing to hear feedback about yourself I think also establish trust.
Managing your emotions is huge.
If you want to fly off the handle with the up of the hat, it's going to be difficult for people to want to 
work with you or want to get into the trusting relationship if they're not sure if you're going to react 
in an uncomfortable way, so managing your emotions is also critical, I think, to establishing trust.
following through with what you've committed to is equally, if not more, important.
And not over promising and under delivering.
You know, occasionally that can happen, but if over promising and under delivering becomes
a consistent, consistent event for you then our trust is going to be difficult to achieve.
One of my favorite authors is Louise Penny, and she created a fictional inspector Amash, and he has 
four sentences that, he says leads to wisdom, but I think that they also lead to trust and so he said 
his guidance to his fictional police team is you have to learn these four sentences and you have to 
mean them when you see them, and the four sentences are: I need help, I don't know, I'm sorry, I 
was wrong, and I totally agree with those four.
So, think about those and how you can incorporate them into your project life and maybe into
your personal life and good luck with the locust.

Building trust on a team is sometimes a challenge for project managers, but some of the ways
that I have dealt with this in the past is by using personality assessments to understand the different 
personalities on the team and then having the team share some of those findings from those 
assessments with their other team members.
I'm also a really big fan of just taking some time during meetings or at the beginning of a call to 
have a little bit of a conversation with members on the team and allowing them to share things 
about our personal hobbies or stories about their life or things that are going on in their life, things 
that they're looking forward to.
I'm a big believer that building trust is really about building those relationships between your team 
members and finding areas where your team really can connect outside of the work that they're 
doing, so assuming that everyone on the team has a shared mission to complete the project or for 
the work that they're doing for the organization or the company that you're working for.
Trust needs to be built outside of that shared mission as well, and one way to do that is to really find 
out about people outside of work and then connect people who have similar interest or similar 
hobbies.
Maybe they're in similar stages in their life and they can connect on a deeper level than
just what they're doing in their day-to-day jobs.
I'm also a fan of some team building exercises sometimes they get a bad rap there are people
who don't like to participate in them, but I do believe that doing some short team building exercises 
that can bring people together in a fun way is a great way to build trust.
I also think that as a project manager and as a leader, trust comes from the top and if your team can 
trust you and you shown yourself to be credible and trustworthy, and that when you say you're 
going to do something, you do that thing, and you get it done.
When you say you're going to get it done, that also helps them become more trustworthy
of one another because you're setting the tone for what trust and report looks like on a team.

There is a gentleman named Patrick Lencioni who wrote a book entitled The Five Dysfunctions
of a Team and I believe his quote says it best.
According to Patrick Lencioni and I quote, Trust is about vulnerability team members
who trust one another learn to be comfortable being open.
Even exposed to one another around their failures, weaknesses and even fears unquote with that,
what are four things that a project manager can do to create a trusting team environment?
Number one, communicate effectively, work hard to gain stakeholder acceptance, support
and enthusiasm for both the project approach and outcomes.
#2 follow Lencioni's guidance.
Take the time to get to know your team, be vulnerable yourself and share.
Create an environment where the team members know they can be open.
Let down their guards and feel safe.
#3 empower the team.
Encourage each member to own and develop their own working environment, agreements and 
decisions, and finally,
#4 develop an approach that aligns with the organizational culture.

First, I like to build strong relationships, effective communication.
And then, of course, lead by example by being a servant leader and with a collaborative
approach.
Most importantly, don't forget to celebrate success.

At the start of a project, I typically express my excitement for the project and maybe a
personal connection I have to it.
People want to know that you genuinely care about it being successful.
I also make a point to check in with people, usually at the start of a meeting, I'll
say, hey, is there anything making you nervous right now?
How are we feeling?
It's important to take the pulse showing empathy is critical, too.
Maybe you have a client that missed a meeting because this product launch wasn't going well, you 
could say: Hey, maybe we'll skip this.
Week's meeting and I'll just chat you if anything urgent comes up.
Good luck out there, it shows you care.
And lastly finding solutions to your teammates problems is a great way to develop rapport.
You could say something like hey, this task seems like it's really frustrating.
What can we do to make this a better experience for you and then start brainstorming solutions
together?
This is probably the best way I've experienced to inspire trust.


Emotional Intelligence

Welcome to "Emotional Intelligence."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define the five components of the emotional intelligence (EQ) theory.
Summarize how project managers can use EQ and identify methods to improve EQ.
Project managers often need to use their emotional skills to inspire team confidence and 
commitment.
Since project managers interact and influence many individuals in an organization, they
can have a large impact.
Imagine two people interacting and then imagine the interaction cascading into project teams,
groups, and the whole organization.
That is the power of influence.
Emotional intelligence, or EQ, determines how well a project manager can form and maintain
relationships, as their decisions can impact many relationships in a complex network.

The Project Management Institute, or PMI, defines emotional intelligence as "the ability
to identify, assess, and manage the emotions of oneself and other people, as well as the 
collective emotions of groups of people."
The emotional intelligence model, which is used globally, includes five components:
Self-awareness, which is the act of knowing your own emotions and how they affect your
thoughts and behavior.
Self-regulation, which involves managing your emotions and impulses so that you can respond
appropriately to situations.
Motivation, which is the ability to motivate yourself and others to achieve goals.
Empathy, which is the understanding other people's emotions and being able to respond
appropriately.
And social skills include the ability to communicate effectively with others, resolve conflicts,
and build relationships.
Let's understand how a project manager can make use of the components of EQ.
Having knowledge about emotional intelligence can help a project manager in many ways,
such as Managing stakeholders, Fostering trust, Making decisions, Leading teams.
Let's look at an example of EQ at work.
Rose is a project manager managing a project to replace city-wide streetlights.
As the project progresses, there is a disagreement between the city officials and the lighting
vendors regarding the delay in project timelines.
The lighting vendors have had an unforeseen issue causing a delay in material supply.
Rose listens to the perspectives of both parties and understands their challenges.
Without being judgmental or biased, Rose focuses on the problem at hand.
This helps her foster trust with both parties.
Further, Rose is able to manage both parties to help them agree to a new acceptable timeline.
A strong EQ is an asset for any project manager.
Every project manager should test their current EQ level and work toward improvement if required.
There are many emotional intelligence assessments that you can take to test EQ levels.
These include tests such as the Emotional and Social Competency Inventory, the Six Seconds
Emotional Intelligence Assessment, and Team Emotional Intelligence.
Some techniques to improve EQ include:
Self-reflection, engaging with your own emotions, and getting feedback from leaders and 
peers to better understand how you are perceived.
In this video, you learned that:
Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is "the ability to identify, assess and manage the emotions
of oneself and other people, as well as the collective emotions of groups of people."
The EQ model includes the five components of self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation,
empathy, and social skills.
EQ helps project managers foster trust, make more rational decisions, manage stakeholders,
become better leaders, and improve project outcomes.
Project managers assess their EQ with a number of assessments and use techniques such as
self-reflection and gathering feedback to improve their EQ.


 
Managing Up
Project managers frequently interact with stakeholders who are in higher-level positions or hold 
influence over a project. In such cases, a project manager may need to manage up.
Objectives
After completing this reading, you will be able to:
•	Define managing up.
•	Identify common stakeholders project managers may need to manage up.
•	Explore tips for managing up.
•	Describe the benefits of managing up.
What is managing up?
Managing up refers to the process of building a productive working relationship with one's 
manager and senior stakeholders to achieve common goals and objectives. It involves 
proactively and strategically communicating with the reporting manager and senior stakeholders, 
anticipating their needs and priorities, and aligning one's work with their expectations.
Successful project managers understand that each role in a project plays a unique and important part 
in the project's success. To effectively manage up, it is important for project managers to 
understand the types of stakeholders that may need to be managed. Some of the most 
common roles that need managed up include:
Reporting manager
The reporting manager is one of the first stakeholders that a project manager will manage up. 
Helping the reporting manager in different ways to help improve their efficiency and efficacy is a 
good strategy.
Senior management
Senior management includes executives, department heads, and other senior leaders within the 
organization who hold decision-making authority over the project. As a project manager, helping 
senior managers understand how project objectives align with organizational goals and 
providing information can help them make more informed decisions.
Clients
Project managers may need to manage up client stakeholders who have contracted the organization 
for the project. Proactively communicating project progress, risks, and issues, helps avoid surprises 
and builds a trusting relationship with clients.
Vendors or Contractors
If the project involves working with external vendors or contractors, project managers may need to 
manage up vendors and contractors to ensure that they are meeting the organization's standards 
and contributing effectively to the project.
As a project manager, it is important to ensure that all these roles are working together effectively, 
and managing up is crucial to the project's success.
How to manage up
Managing up can feel uncomfortable at first. However, it is an important skill for a project manager. 
Here are some tips for effectively managing up.
Build a relationship
Building a positive relationship is key to managing up with managers or colleagues who hold 
influence over a project manager's work. The project manager must get to know them and their 
work style and establish a rapport based on trust and mutual respect.
Communicate effectively
Clear communication is crucial when managing up. The project manager must make sure to 
articulate their goals and priorities clearly and be proactive in communicating updates and progress.
Anticipate their needs
The project manager must try to anticipate the needs and preferences of the stakeholder being 
managed up and tailor work accordingly. For example, a project manager may need to adjust 
their work style and prioritize the stakeholder's requests while providing timely updates.
Show initiative
The project manager should proactively take on tasks or responsibilities that will help the 
stakeholder or the project succeed. This can help demonstrate your value and build trust.
Be collaborative
Rather than seeing the stakeholder as a potential obstacle, the project manager should view them as 
a partner in achieving shared goals. Look for ways to collaborate and work together effectively.
Be respectful
Even when managing up, the project manager must maintain respect for the stakeholder's 
position and authority. The project manager must never undermine a stakeholder's authority or act 
in a way that could be seen as insubordination.
The benefits of managing up
Project managers who successfully manage up can benefit in several ways.
Improved communication
When project managers effectively manage up, they establish clear lines of communication with 
their superiors and stakeholders, which helps ensure that expectations and priorities are aligned. 
This can reduce misunderstandings and delays and ensure that the project runs more smoothly.
Increased support
By building positive working relationships with their manager and senior stakeholders, project 
managers can gain greater support for their project. This can include access to additional resources, 
buy-in from stakeholders, and increased visibility within the organization.
Greater autonomy
When project managers effectively manage up, they may be given more autonomy to make 
decisions and take action. This can help them be more efficient and effective in their work and build 
their confidence and sense of ownership over the project.
Career advancement
Successfully managing up can demonstrate a project manager's leadership and communication 
skills, which can be valuable for career advancement opportunities within the organization. It can 
also increase the likelihood of being entrusted with more complex and high-profile projects in the 
future.
Conclusion
In conclusion, managing up is a crucial skill for project managers to have, especially when 
dealing with stakeholders who hold higher-level positions or have influence over a project. By 
building positive relationships, communicating effectively, anticipating needs, showing initiative, 
being collaborative, and maintaining respect, project managers can successfully manage up to 
achieve shared goals and objectives. The benefits of managing up include improved 
communication, increased support, greater autonomy, and career advancement opportunities. 
By mastering the art of managing up, project managers can ensure the success of their projects and 
advance their careers within their organization.
Adaptability and Resilience

Welcome to "Adaptability and Resilience."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define adaptability and resilience.
Discuss examples of adaptability and resilience.
Implement adaptability and resilience traits to effective communications and leadership.
Netflix started as a DVD rental-by-mail service. Customers could order DVDs online and receive 
them in the mail.
Ten years later Netflix, powered by new streaming technologies, launched its online streaming 
service, allowing customers to watch movies and TV shows directly on their computers.
Since then, video streaming has become one of the primary ways that people consume media.
But, even with the challenge of increased competition, Netflix has continued to evolve and is 
considered a leading streaming platform.
This example illustrates the leadership characteristics of adaptability and resilience.
Netflix has adapted over the years to stay relevant.
And they have shown resilience by continually moving forward despite challenges, such as a 
heavily competitive market.
Adaptability and resilience are two essential qualities necessary for effective leadership.
Adaptability refers to the ability to adjust to changing circumstances and situations.
Let's look at some of the benefits of being adaptable.
Adaptable leaders can quickly assess new situations, make necessary changes to their plans,
and effectively navigate unexpected challenges.
For example, during COVID-19, organizations had to adapt quickly to the idea of a remote 
workforce and make the required adjustments to technology and behaviours.
Those who struggled perished.
Resilience, however, refers to recovering quickly from setbacks and failures.
Resilient leaders can maintain their focus and motivation even when things don't go as 
planned.
A resilient leader might face a significant setback such as losing a key employee or a failed product 
launch.
Rather than giving up, they can use the experience as a learning opportunity and develop a new 
plan.
They maintain their focus and motivation and can inspire their team to do the same.
Adaptability and resilience are good traits for a project manager to have.
Some common ways that project managers need to apply adaptability and resilience are the 
following:
Adjusting communication style
Being open to feedback
Embracing change
Staying focused.
Let's look at some examples to understand adaptability and resilience better.
When many companies shifted to remote work during COVID-19, there was a huge impact on 
communication between team members and stakeholders.
Short hallway conversations and mid-day coffee brainstorms were no longer possible.
And asynchronous communication methods, like team chats, became even more popular.
In this scenario, project managers had to quickly study and adapt to their team members' 
communication styles and preferences.
Amidst all this, the project managers had to ensure everyone followed the organization's work 
policies.
The project managers tried to adapt their communication approaches to different communication 
preferences, which helped keep teams engaged and motivated to work towards project goals.
In the end, success came to project managers who could adapt to change.
Here's another example.
Imagine a project manager leading a construction project to build a new office block.
The project manager receives news of supply shortages for a special type of wood and steel 
specified in the development plans.
Changing the material will require changing the building permits.
In this scenario, the project manager should not make a rash decision.
Instead, the project manager can contact team members, stakeholders, and other project leaders for 
feedback and ideas.
For example, construction contractors can provide feedback on alternative materials.
Local officials and regulators can provide feedback on how to expedite the permit process and 
suggest alternative solutions to meet any regulatory requirements.
Resilience is key.
As a good leader, a project manager should constantly look for solutions and never give up.

In this video, you learned that:
Adaptability and resilience are two important qualities
that are necessary for effective leadership.
Adaptability refers to the ability to adjust to changing circumstances and situations.
Resilience refers to the ability to recover quickly from setbacks and failures.
Project managers can apply adaptability and resilience
by adjusting their communication styles, being open to feedback, embracing change, and 
staying focused.

Expert Viewpoints: Overcoming Resource 
Planning Challenges

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Overcoming Resource Challenges.
In this video, we will hear experts and leaders discuss overcoming resource challenges.
How did you overcome resource planning challenges you have encountered?
Resource planning challenges can be very real and very critical,
and when you get to a larger size company or you start having multiple projects running in parallel 
of competing priority, resource management and capacity planning becomes more difficult.
So one, you need to have a clear understanding as a resource planner of what the tasks are,
how long they're going to take in general, and when your projects are gonna wrap up
so that you can start the synchronized conducting of resourcing.
Second is, once you've come up with good resourcing plans you see the ebb and flow of the 
projects, you begin to identify peaks and valleys.
For us, July and September tend to be slower months and so "How can I take advantage as a 
resource planner of slower months, when December and through April is a just insane race to get 
work done?"
So I look for trends as far as our projects. I look for resource alignment.
Are there project teams that work really well together on specific projects?
Are there others where it just doesn't work out? We have to rematch.
I look for that. And then I also bring in other people.
So, within our organization at Skill-Up, each team is responsible for their own resources, but 
managing and prioritizing projects across the entire company is my responsibility.
And so I have to understand everybody's schedules almost and commitments and
project commitments so that I can advise swaps:
"We need more instructional designers here," or "I've got a high priority there."
How can I send people over to the right spots at the right time and not completely derail other 
projects that need to continue?
So to do that, I meet with all my leads, all my managers, and then all of our supporting teams as 
well. And understand workloads, capacity challenges, and then I can make those decisions
better informed in the moment-- I don't get them all right, but I try to be as informed as I can.

I would say the greatest resource challenge I encounter is a failure to plan and manage resource 
risks.
A project requires a defined number of personnel, equipment, supplies, materials and potentially 
other miscellaneous resources such as licenses or permits.
Unfortunately, many project managers assume that resources will be available when needed.
and find this assumption was erroneous as the project progresses.
Planning is the key--So the logical follow-up question is, "How do you overcome them?"
Well, let's share a step-by-step approach and see if we can answer this question.
Step number one.
Break out the project into phases and chronological activities that must be accomplished.
The best tool to accomplish this is referred to as a Work Breakdown Structure or WBS.
Step number two.
Assign core team members who are knowledgeable on each activity in that work breakdown 
structure.
It is their job to define all resource requirements for that particular activity.
Step number three.
Document all activities and resource requirements on a tool called the Resource Breakdown 
Structure.
This tool defines each resource required, by activity, and defines when the resource will be required.
And finally, determine who manages and distributes the resources you need.
Share your time-phased resource breakdown structure with these individuals.
Identify any risks upfront and begin working those responses ahead of time.

I was working on a project a few years ago with a company that I was with and I was leading a team 
to redo the website of a major tech company.
And my team was responsible for creating content for about 30 pages of the website, and we only 
had one content writer at the time.
and as we were looking at the project schedule and trying to figure out how we were going to get 
everything done, we realized there was no way that we would be able to complete the project with 
just one resource.
So, I was facing some resourcing challenges.
There was not anyone else that was available, on different teams, or other teams to support my 
content writer, and we really just needed some folks to write content for the website.
So, I actually had to go to the manager that was above me to let her know, first of all, that we were 
going to have resourcing issues, and that we had resourcing issues, and that the timeline was going 
to be impacted if we didn't get any more resources, and in working with her, we discussed that there 
was potentially a budget to bring on some more resources, but it also wasn't *her* decision.
So, her and I had to come up with a plan:
"How many resources did we actually think that we were going to need?"
"How long did we think that we were going to need those resources for?"
"What skills did those resources need to have?" and then, "What was the available budget that we 
had to spend on those resources?" and then we actually took that to our VP, that plan to our VP, and 
requested that we get some contracting resources just for the duration of the project.
So, her and I had to put together this plan and then we pitched it to the VP of our department who 
approved the use of contractors and approved our plan.
But then I was stuck because I needed... the resources!
I had the *money* for the resources now, I was approved to get the resources, but I still didn't have 
those resources.
so I actually had to-- and I needed them very quickly-- so I actually had to tap some people in my 
network to ask them
a) If they wanted to do this work, if they were available to work, and if they wanted to do this work.
And if they didn't, if they knew anyone who would be available to do that work and have the skill 
set that we needed.
And so within a few days of getting the budget and the plan approved,
I was doing interviews and talking to some people that we could use as contracting resources.
And we were really able to find just two or three people who could work for a short amount of time,
they were were willing to do the role, they had the skills that we needed, and we were able to get 
those people within our budget.

Key Takeaways
Effective communications, stakeholder management, and leadership can be the difference between 
project success or failure. Effective communications, stakeholder management, and leadership can 
be the difference between project success or failure. This course provided guidance and examples 
on how to create a healthy project foundation-the course then dove into effective communications 
building blocks.
The key takeaways from this course include:
•	The best project managers always put their people first. They place the right people in the 
right roles. Fostering an empowering and problem-solving mindset.
•	Communicate project objectives that are crisp, understandable, and actionable. They ensure 
a common understanding of what the project will and will not produce and avoid scope 
creep.
•	Strive to be a servant leader. Work alongside your team and put them first. This will build 
trust and help you better understand project details, discover issues, and succeed.
•	Understand the criticality of having effective conversations early and throughout the project. 
Practice key communication skills essential to project success. Examine areas such as 
written, oral, public speaking, presentation skills, teamwork, collaboration, and negotiation.
•	Develop a process for managing end-to-end project communications. Identify challenges 
and potential solutions to ensure effective communications.
•	Understand various media options available and the advantages and disadvantages of each. 
Research and select the most appropriate media. Understand the difference between 
synchronous and asynchronous communications and select the media that matches the need.
•	Understand the impact of culture on effective communications. Avoid allowing project 
communications to be dependent upon the grapevine.
•	Understand and practice the concept of failing fast. Know when a failing fast mindset can be 
advantageous. Understand potential areas where a project may fail.
•	Know the key roles required for the project to be successful. Assign roles and 
responsibilities using common RACI methodology. Ensure the team commits to their role.
•	Critical Path method is a scheduling technique that estimates the minimum project duration 
and allows you to determine how much scheduling flexibility you have on all schedule 
paths. Critical Chain is another scheduling methodology that adds resource and time buffers 
to all schedule paths to guard against potential resource shortages and delays. Use both 
methods to your advantage.
•	Develop and implement a Communications Management Plan. This plan defines all critical 
communications items, ensures information gets to the right stakeholders in a timely manner 
and enhances efficient and effective communications. Key communications items covered 
include virtual meetings and status reporting.
•	All stakeholders communicate differently. There are four basic communication styles. Adapt 
your message as much as possible to meet the audience's style and needs to improve 
communications effectiveness.
•	Attributes of a good leader were shared. You had an opportunity to assess your leadership 
strengths and weaknesses and develop an initial action plan to improve your leadership 
skills.
•	The Tuckman Ladder is a popular model that shares the steps a team must take to become 
highly productive. The model discusses readiness levels of an individual in each stage and 
provides a recommended leadership approach. Good leaders understand that each individual 
has different levels of ability and confidence and adapts their leadership situationally to meet 
those needs.
•	The difference between a manager and a leader was highlighted. A successful project 
manager should excel in both roles. We discussed the importance of knowledge sharing. 
Understand various categories of information you receive and use it to your advantage.
•	There may be times when you don't have all the information you need or adequate time to 
make an objective decision. Intuitive decision-making is a skill you need to develop and 
apply on those occasions.
•	A project manager must identify all required resources. Once identified, develop a plan that 
shares when resources are needed and in what quantity. Finally, the project manager must 
manage and control the resources provided wisely. A resource breakdown structure (RBS) is 
a great tool to accomplish these goals.
•	A project manager should strive to establish a culture of trust. In addition, a successful 
project manager displays high levels of Emotional Intelligence. Begin with self-awareness 
and learn to self-manage. From there, social awareness will increase, and relationships will 
gel.
•	The ability to effectively manage up is critical. In addition, adaptability and resilience are 
skills to work on and improve.
•	There are many reasons why projects fail. At the top of the list are poor communications, 
inadequate stakeholder management, and a lack of effective leadership. Use tools and 
techniques provided in this course to move your project management skills to the next level.

Introduction to Computing Fundamentals 

Welcome to "Introduction to Computing Fundamentals."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define what a computer is.
Classify computers based on their size and their uses.
List the four functions of computing and the parts of a computer associated with those
functions, and
Describe the benefits of computing.
A computer is a device or system that includes hardware, operating system software, application
software, and peripheral devices.
Hardware is the platform that processes data based on the provided instructions and stores
data.
Software includes the operating system software that enables and configures hardware capabilities
and the application software that enables the computer to perform tasks.
Peripheral devices such as keyboards and monitors enable user input and output.
And finally, computers need users who provide instructions.
A fast way to classify computers is by their size and speed.
Supercomputers are the fastest computers and are used for the most complex mathematical
and analytical computations.
Mainframe computers function "at the speed of business" and are used to perform transactions
and more.
Next in size and speed are minicomputers, which enable more than one person to access
the same data.
Finally, the smallest computers are microcomputers.
This category includes personal computers, laptops, smartphones, and other single-user
devices.
Another way to classify computers is by use.
General-purpose computers perform functions such as creating documents, saving files,
web conferencing, working online, financial analysis, data analytics, coding, and other
multi-function capabilities.
Even smartphones can be considered general-purpose computers.
Special-purpose computers, which perform defined, limited use functions, include IoT devices
such as sensors that report water quality, lights that activate during occupancy, sensors
that report building occupancy, and IoT devices that monitor manufacturing processes.
Other types of computers include Wi-Fi-enabled appliances, weather stations, alarm systems,
and both wired and wireless gaming consoles, .
Computers perform many tasks, but we can simplify and categorize those tasks into four easy-to-
remember functions:
Input,
Processing,
Output,
and Storage.
Let's learn more.
Input is the function, or action, of getting data into the computer.
Input happens when you type or tap on a keyboard, use a touchscreen, or speak a voice-to-text
command.
Clicking the Send button for an email is also input.
Input is also the information and instructions a programmer provides to perform calculations
using a set of programs.
Next, processing happens when the computer receives the input and then converts that data into a 
format or action that a user can recognize and use.
Examples include downloading an app, document, or photo and moving data from one drive to
another.
Processing also occurs when the computer performs programming instructions, such as data 
calculations,
or even instructions to fly a rocket to the stratosphere and back.
Technically, processing happens when raw data changes into usable formats such as email, 
documents, and photos.
Processors, also called central processing units or CPUs, are located inside computers on a system 
board, also called a motherboard.
These boards and their processors are usually located centrally within the devices.
Next, the computer delivers the processed results to the default or configured output devices 
including monitors, speakers, and printers.
Output, meaning what you see, hear, or understand, is what makes the data apparent and valuable.
At the same time, or just after the processing function completes, and while output is happening,
computers can use the storage function.
Storage is the saving of data to disk space on your computer, an external hard drive, or on network 
or cloud storage for an indefinite or undefined time unless you explicitly specify a data expiration 
date or delete the data.
Storage saves data for reuse.
Server, desktop, and laptop computer storage is usually located inside of the case and to the side of 
the case.
Storage is often welded onto the system board for phones, IOT, and gaming devices.
So, what are the advantages of using computers?
Manual entry errors are eliminated by using capabilities such as copy and paste and data duplication 
to reuse data or content.
Communication is sped up by using network, wireless, cellular, and other communication 
technologies.
Exponential and complex computations such as those used for medical research, civil engineering 
and space exploration are enabled by processors, memory, and programming languages.
storage space needed for stacks of paper.
Businesses thrive on digital data storage.
And, whether it's medical images, car claims, research records, or family photos, saving digital 
images provides durable and long-lasting access to that information.
Finally, editing capabilities eliminate the time-consuming drudgery of having to erase and rewrite 
work manually.

In this video, you learned that:
Based on size and speed, supercomputers are the fastest, followed by mainframes, then
minicomputers, and finally microcomputers, which include PCs, laptops, smartphones, and
others.
Computers can perform general functions or specific functions.
The four functions of computing are input, processing, output, and storage.
And, the benefits of computing include reducing the number of tasks humans need to do, enhanced
data storage, the ability to perform complex mathematical tasks, and faster communications.

Common Computing Devices and Platforms

Welcome to "Common Computing Devices and their Platforms."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Categorize common computing devices and describe their main features and benefits.
And identify frequently used operating platforms associated with these devices.
Common computing devices include
stationary computing devices,
mobile computing devices, and
Internet of things or IoT devices.
Stationary devices, which include workstations, servers, and tabletop gaming consoles, remain
on a desk, or rack, or other fixed location.
These devices consist of a box that includes processors, memory, and input and output connections
that connect to networks, keyboards, monitors, mice, printers, speakers, microphones, webcams,
and other devices.
In some instances, you can update the device's memory, storage, or video cards.
Let's explore workstations.
Workstations, used both at the office and at home, are what most people think of when
they think about a desktop computer.
Also categorized with personal computers, these devices are typically in a box that
contains a system board with a processor, memory, storage, and slots for add-on cards
for additional functions.
Their motherboards have ports that support monitors, keyboards, mice, microphones, printers,
speakers, and other devices as well as onboard cards for wireless connectivity.
Many newer devices enable memory, storage, and graphic card upgrades.
These devices use Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
Next, servers are generally installed as standalone units or in stacked racks on networks enabling
shared access to media such as movies, videos, and sound clips and web pages for websites.
Servers also manage print requests, enable shared data and document access, store email,
and more.
On the network, multiple servers can contain the same data so that if one server fails,
users can keep working using the same data from other servers.
The ability for work to continue if a shared computing resource is malfunctioning is known
as fault tolerance.
Server hardware offers robust capabilities that often support multiple processors, memory,
graphic cards, storage, and port connections within the same box.
Servers use network operating systems geared towards optimizing data distribution.
Popular operating system software vendors include Microsoft Windows Server, Linux, UNIX,
macOS X, and FreeBSD.
Desktop gaming consoles are also known as tabletop gaming consoles.
Gaming console system boards contain processors, memory, graphics processors, storage, input
ports, output ports, and a memory controller that exists separately between the other function
blocks and the system memory.
In times past, many of these functions existed separately as multiple chips on the motherboard,
but today these functions exist in a single functional block.
Gaming consoles, such as those made by Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, are similar to desktop
computers, but use upgraded memory caching and graphics processing to enable smoother
game-playing experiences.
Gaming consoles used to require cable connections to monitors and gaming controllers.
Today's gaming consoles provide wireless connectivity.
Gaming consoles are not usually upgradeable.
Mobile devices, including laptops, tablets, mobile phones, and portable gaming systems
have transformed how we live, work, and play.
Let's first check out laptops.
Many laptop computers run versions of Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems,
while others use Google Chrome's lightweight operating system.
Laptop system boards include processors, memory, video cards, ports for connecting to other
devices, and Wi-Fi capability.
Many laptop manufacturers allow upgrades to storage and memory.
Tablet devices are usually less powerful than laptops, but that is beginning to change.
Tablets, built in very tight cases, include most laptop components but don't include a
keyboard.
Tablets generally use operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, iOS, and Chrome.
The system board includes the device's processor, memory, a video card, sound card, a limited
number of ports, a Wi-Fi card, and limited hard drive storage.
Tablets are usually not upgradeable.
Mobile phones include onboard components with specialized processors, memory, sound, and
video capabilities.
Phones can include a slot for a SIM card that links the phone to a cell phone access provider
and a slotted port for additional storage, All phones include one multifunctional port
primarily used to recharge the phone's battery.
Mobile phone operating systems, built for speed, are specially designed to support multiple
communication spectrum capabilities including the designated cell phone frequencies, Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi, near field communications, and other connectivity options.
Android and iOS operating systems dominate the market.
But with practically all components welded onto the board, you can only upgrade the software,
not the hardware.
Portable gaming devices use specialized processors, storage, and memory, and include battery and
	multi-use ports for power, Wi-Fi, and other connectivity options.
These devices use operating systems specially configured for mobile use, and many of those
operating systems are Linux-derived.
Gaming software is usually onboard or downloadable, and the hardware is generally not 
upgradeable.
Internet of things, known as IoT devices, describes physical objects that have sensors,
processing ability, software, and other technologies that enable these devices to exchange data
with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.
IoT devices communicate via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, Zigbee, and other protocols.
They can receive software updates, but generally the hardware within a limited space is soldered
to the board and is not upgradeable.
Let's learn more.
Widely available consumer IoT devices include smart speakers, TVs, wearable devices such
as fitness trackers, and appliances such as automatic floor vacuums, stoves, and others.
Light bulbs, toys, thermostats, and medical devices are also part of today's IoT world.
Enterprise IoT devices enable organizations to offer consumers more targeted features
and manage costs.
For example, utilities install smart meters to help both residential and commercial customers
manage their energy usage.
Occupancy sensors and IoT-enabled security systems help businesses prevent losses and
enhance worker and customer safety.
Similarly, industrial IoT devices help organizations monitor the weather, operate robots, assess
water and air quality, and more.
In this video, you learned that:
Common computing devices currently fit into three categories: stationary devices, mobile
devices, and IoT devices.
Desktop computers, mobile computers, and IoT devices feature a processor and input and
output ports or capabilities.
Desktop machines usually offer the most upgrade capabilities, while IoT devices are generally
not upgradeable.
And desktop operating systems include Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, or Unix while Google
Android, Google Chrome, and Apple's iOS operating systems dominate the mobile operating 
system
market.


Identifying Hardware Components and 
Peripherals 

Welcome to Identifying hardware components and peripherals.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain the difference between internal and external components,
Describe what a peripheral device is and what it does, and
Apply your learning to contrast an interface, a port, and a connector.
What is a computer component?
It's a physical part needed for computer functioning, also called "hardware".
And each component performs a specific task.
Components can be internal or external.
External components connect via ports, which are openings on the sides of a computer.
Without a given component, such as a CPU, a computer system cannot function as desired.
An internal component is a piece of hardware inside the computer. Examples include:
Random Access Memory (RAM) which is the computer's working memory, and it is temporary, 
storing
items you are working with as long as the power is on. If you're working on a document,
and the power goes off, the document is lost.
The hard drive is permanent storage that can you save a file to. A file stored on the hard
drive is permanently stored and will not be lost if the power fails.
And the CPU, which does all the math calculations in a computer. It's often called the brain
of the computer. The faster the CPU, the more things the computer can do at a given time.
A peripheral is a device which connects to a computer to provide extra functionality.
It is used in the transfer of data to or from a computer. Peripherals can be easily connected
to and removed from a computer system.
Peripherals attach to the computer through a connector.
The type of connector varies with the peripheral.
Examples include a mouse, keyboard, and printer.
There are three kinds of peripherals:
input devices which send commands and data to the computer.
output devices which receive commands from the computer.
and storage devices which are a type of permanent memory for files you want to keep indefinitely.
A connector is the unique end of a plug, jack, or the edge of a card that connects to a port.
For example, all desktop computer expansion cards have an internal connector that allows
them to connect in a slot on the motherboard.
A Universal Serial Bus (USB) connector at the end of a cable is an example of an external
connector.
A connector plugs into an opening on a computer called a port.
A port is the jack or receptacle for a peripheral device to plug into.
Ports are standardized for each purpose.
Some common ports are Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports and High-Definition Multimedia
Interface (HDMI) ports. The HDMI port pictured here could be used to connect a monitor.
In this video, you learned that:
A component of a computer is a physical part needed for computer functioning.
Examples of internal components include memory and a hard drive.
Examples of external components include ports and connectors.
The end of a plug or cable is called a connector.
Connectors fit into one specific type of opening called a port.
And a peripheral device can connect externally or internally.


Reading: Input, Output, and Display Devices

In the world of computing, input, and output devices play a crucial role in converting information 
into a format that humans can easily comprehend. In this reading, you will explore what input and 
output devices do and learn about some common examples of each. You will also learn to define 
and identify display, audio, and visual devices and how this technology combines with the human 
senses to create a rich multimedia experience.
Input Devices
An input device is any hardware component that allows users to enter data or commands into a 
computer or other electronic device. Input devices capture and convert different input types, such as 
text, numbers, images, and gestures, into a format the computer can understand.










A pointing device (keyboard, mouse, joystick, touchpad, or trackball) moves the cursor on a 
computer screen. Keyboards are used primarily to input data and are typically attached to the 
computer via a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port, although older machines may use an IBM Personal 
System/2 (PS/2) port.
The mouse is the most-used input device, used primarily to input data and move the cursor. A 
mouse generally connects to a computer via a USB port, which is a wired connection. You can also 
connect a mouse via a wireless Bluetooth connection.
Touchpads are most often used on laptops. Touchpads are built into laptops and don't need to be 
connected externally. However, you can purchase an external touchpad for a laptop and connect 
through USB or Wi-Fi.
The camera is another input device that produces a digital image on the computer. A camera 
generally connects to a computer via a USB port, which is a wired connection. You can also connect 
a camera via a wireless Bluetooth connection. Cameras are typically built into laptops and don't 
need to be connected externally. However, you can purchase an external camera for a laptop and 
connect through USB or Wi-Fi.
A joystick sends commands to the computer. It moves the cursor and is often used to play games. 
You can connect it to the computer via a USB cable or wireless Bluetooth.
Trackballs also send commands to the computer, although computer mice have largely replaced 
them. People with mobility issues might find the trackball a more comfortable alternative to a 
mouse.
A pointing device is a type of input tool. As such, you can use it to move the cursor and additional 
commands to the computer.
A pointing stick or stylus is typically used on tablets. Most styluses work via capacitive 
technology, which is about heat and pressure. When you push the stylus onto the screen, it 
senses the heat and pressure and elicits a response.
Output Devices
An output device is any hardware that converts information into a human-readable form. A 
computer can function without an output device. However, without an output device, there's no way 
to determine what the computer is doing.









A common output device is a printer, which is a machine for putting text or pictures onto paper. 
There are four main types of printers:
•	Laser printers: Uses a heated unit to fuse ink onto paper.
•	LED printers: Also known as laser printers, has a photoreceptive drum whose surface is 
positively charged with static electricity by a high voltage wire. The paper passes between 
two heated rollers, fusing the toner to the page before it comes out of the printer.
•	Inkjet printers: Has a print head containing thousands of tiny holes. These openings put 
microscopic droplets of ink onto paper very quickly. Inkjet machines use a liquid ink 
produced by either a colored dye or a liquid that contains solid pigments.
•	Thermal printers: Heats specially coated paper to turn sections black and are used in point-
of-sale terminals and fax machines.
A networked printer is connected to a network, using Ethernet or Wi-Fi. Whereas a local printer 
would be cabled to the device that requires it, a networked printer can be accessed by multiple 
devices simultaneously on the same network. An IP-based printer is part of an IP network. It often 
refers to Unix computers that use a specific protocol for printing. Like an IP-based printer, a web-
based printer can receive documents through a network and via the Internet rather than a direct 
connection to a computer.
An image scanner, or scanner, optically scans images, printed text, or an object and converts it from 
an analog format to a digital image. This creates an electronic version of the document that can be 
viewed on a monitor or screen and edited on a computer. Commonly used in offices are variations 
of the desktop flatbed scanner, where the document is placed on a glass window for scanning. 
Flatbed scanners have been replaced by multi-function devices.
A fax machine is a device that is used to send documents over a telephone network. The 
transmissions can be between two fax machines, or between a fax machine and computer, or an 
online fax service.
Often the functions of a printer, scanner, and fax machine are combined in one device, known as a 
multifunction device (or MFD).
Display Devices
A display device is a hardware component for outputting information in visual form. Visually 
impaired people can choose a tactile monitor that presents the information in a fingertip-readable 
format.
Typical applications for display devices are television sets and computer monitors. A cathode ray 
tube (or CRT) monitor is an analog device that creates an image on the screen by directing three 
electron beams over millions of phosphor dots to light them up. CRT monitors were commonly used 
in televisions and computer monitors throughout the mid-to-late 1900s. By 1990, IBM's extended 
graphics array (XGA) display boasted 16.8 million colors in 800 x 600-pixel resolution.
Flat screens are also known as liquid crystal display (LCD) or thin film transistor (TFT) monitors. A 
digital signal drives the color value of each picture element or pixel. They replaced the larger and 
heavier analog CRT monitors.
Touchscreens use a touch panel on an electronic display. Their capacitive technology measures heat 
and pressure. They are often found on smartphones, laptops, and tablets.
Projectors are output devices that can take images from a computer and display them on a screen, 
wall, or other surface. The surface projected onto is usually large, flat, and lightly colored, such as a 
wall or whiteboard. The projected images are either still (like slides) or moving pictures.
Screen resolution refers to the clarity of the text and images displayed on your screen. At higher 
resolutions, such as 1600 x 1200 pixels, items appear sharper. Older CRT monitors generally 
display a lower resolution of only 800 × 600 or 1024 × 768 pixels.
Microsoft Windows uses plug-and-play installation to locate and install a device driver when you 
connect the device. Hot-swappable devices such as monitors do not require a system restart to 
connect or disconnect.
Audio and Visual Devices
On its own, your computer can't make a sound. Digital data from audio and video files need to be 
turned into something that our ears can hear, which requires specialized hardware and processing in 
the form of audio devices. Audio devices refer to components that reproduce, record, or process 
sound. This includes microphones, CD players, amplifiers, mixing consoles, effects units, and 
speakers. Visual devices are units capable of presenting images electronically on a screen. Typically, 
such devices have a display greater than four inches when measured diagonally. Images can be 
displayed on smartphones, computer monitors, and laptop computers.
A computer speaker is an output hardware device. It connects to a computer to generate sound. The 
computer's sound card creates the signal to produce sound.
A microphone, sometimes abbreviated as mic, is a hardware peripheral and input device. A 
microphone allows computer users to input audio into their computers.
Sometimes referred to as earphones, headphones are a hardware output device that plugs into a 
computer line out or speaker port. Headphones allow you to listen to audio without disturbing 
people around you. Headphones can be connected via a port on a PC or linked via a Bluetooth 
wireless connection. With a wired connection, a 3.5-millimeter jack or a USB connection may be 
used to connect the headphones to a PC.
A webcam feeds an image or video in real time to a network like the Internet. Webcams can be used 
during a video chat and offer a compact video recording device. Modern webcams are usually high 
resolution with 1080p (pixels) or high definition (HD). They can be built-in into laptops or attached 
using a USB.
Internal Computer Components

Welcome to "Internal Computer Components."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Recognize several internal computer components.
Explore the role of a motherboard.
And evaluate the importance of data flow.
A motherboard is the main printed circuit board, or PCB, in computers and other expandable 
systems.
Motherboards contain significant subsystems, such as the chip set's input/output and
memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.
Motherboards allow communication among many crucial electronic components, such as the central 
processing unit (CPU) and memory.
And motherboards also provide communication pathways for peripherals such as keyboards and 
other components.
A chip set is a set of electronic components in an integrated circuit that manage data flow among the 
processor, memory, and peripherals.
A chip set has two parts, the northbridge and the southbridge, which manage communications 
among the CPU and other parts of the motherboard.
A northbridge chip, or host bridge, is one of the two chips in the core logic chip set on a 
motherboard.
Unlike the southbridge chip, the northbridge chip connects directly to the CPU via the front-side 
bus and performs high-performance tasks.
The southbridge chip, the second part of the chip set, generally implements
slower-performance tasks. And a southbridge chip is usually not directly connected to the CPU.
A bus is a high-speed internal connection embedded as printed circuits on the motherboard.
A bus sends control signals and data among the CPU and other internal components. It's like the 
information superhighway of the computer.
A front-side bus is a computer communication interface that carries data between the CPU
and the memory controller hub, or the northbridge. A socket is the array of pins and the securing 
mechanism that hold a processor in place and connect the processor to the motherboard.
Socket pin connections differ depending on which generation of CPU your motherboard supports.
Older sockets use a pin grid array (PGA) that uses short, stiff pins on the CPU that align with the 
holes on the socket. When installing a CPU do not force the CPU into the socket. If the CPU and 
socket are correctly matched, the CPU should fit.
Newer motherboard sockets, called land grid arrays (LGAs), have built-in pins and the CPUs have 
contact points on them.
A power connector is a device found on a motherboard that allows an electrical current to pass 
through it to provide power to a device.
Not all power connectors look alike.
An ATX-style connector is one of the larger power connectors inside a computer. These connectors 
join the power supply to the motherboard.

In this video, you learned that:
Internal computer components include everything connected to the motherboard.
A motherboard provides a communication pathway for peripherals.
Buses send control signals and data between the CPU and other components.
Components not directly attached to a motherboard connect via sockets.
And sockets are the architecture of pins that allow CPU installation.

Reading: Additional Internal Computer 
Components

Video Card
The video card allows the computer to send graphical information to a video display device, such as 
a monitor. Video cards, also known as a display adapter, graphics card, video adapter, video board, 
or video controller, can either be an expansion card in an empty slot on the motherboard or a chip 
built into a system's motherboard.
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized processor initially designed to accelerate graphics 
rendering. GPUs can process many pieces of data simultaneously, making them useful for machine 
learning, video editing, and gaming applications. Although GPUs are typically associated with 
realistic graphics in top-quality video games, several industries rely on their powerful processing 
capabilities.
Audio Card
An audio card is also known as a sound card. It's an integrated circuit that generates an audio signal 
and sends it to a computer's speakers. The sound card can accept an analog sound (from a 
microphone or audiotape) and convert it to digital data stored in an audio file. Conversely, it can 
accept digitized audio signals (from an audio file) and convert them to analog signals that can be 
played on the computer's speakers.
Midi Controller
A Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) controller is a simple way to sequence music and 
play virtual instruments on your PC. It sends MIDI data to a computer or synthesizer, which 
interprets the signal and produces a sound. Musicians frequently use MIDI controllers.
Network Interface Card (NIC)
A computer cannot connect to a network without a network interface card (NIC). This is a circuit 
board installed in a computer that provides a dedicated network connection to the computer. The 
card receives network signals and translates them into data that the computer displays. Originally, 
network controllers were available only as expansion cards that could be plugged into a computer 
port, router, or USB device. Onboard NICs are built into the motherboard. Add-on NICs fit into an 
open expansion slot on the motherboard.
In terms of function, speed, and quality, there's no significant difference between the types of NICs. 
Wireless NICs rely on an antenna to communicate through radio frequency waves on a Wi-Fi 
connection. Wired NICs rely on an input jack and wired LAN technology, such as fast Ethernet.
Modems
On a basic level, your modem gives you access to the Internet. From Wi-Fi routers to mobile 
devices, the components that make up your home network all speak different digital languages, but 
your modem is the translator. It translates the signals coming from your Internet Service Provider, 
or ISP, into an Internet connection for your Wi-Fi router to broadcast. The modem receives 
information from your ISP through the phone lines, optical fiber, or coaxial cable in your home 
(depending on your service provider) and converts it into a digital signal. Your router and ISP can't 
communicate directly because they speak different languages-or rather, they transmit different 
signal types. So, the modem digitizes those signals and sends the now usable signals to the router. 
Before you know it, you're online.
System Cooling
Computers generate heat, and too much heat can damage internal components. You should never 
operate a computer without ensuring a proper cooling system (air or liquid) is installed. Central 
Processing Unit (CPU) coolers are designed to dissipate heat produced by the processor at the heart 
of your PC. The fans, radiators, and other cooling components allow the accumulated heat energy to 
flow away from vital internal parts. There are many cooling methods available.
Cooling Methods
Passive cooling slows the speed at which a component, such as a processor, operates. This approach 
contrasts with active cooling, which involves using powered fans instead. Fans in the computer case 
draw cool air through the front vents and expel warm air through the back. In this process, the fans 
dissipate warm air from delicate internal components.
With forced convection, hot air around an object, such as the CPU, is moved away by a fan blowing 
air across a heatsink. Thermal paste and a baseplate rest between the water block and CPU to help 
improve the heat transfer properties.
One approach to system cooling is to use a heat sink, which is a passive component of conductive 
metal. This method disperses warm air before it can harm components inside the computer. First, 
add a heat sink compound to fill gaps between the CPU and other heat-generating components and 
the mechanical heat sink. Then place the heat sink over the CPU. Now excess heat is drawn from 
the CPU through the heat sink to its fins, where a fan blows air to dissipate the excess heat.
Liquid cooling works very much like a radiator in your car or home. It's quieter and more efficient 
than using fans to cool your system. Liquid cooling circulates liquid through "water blocks," which 
rest on the chip being cooled. The relatively cooler liquid circulating through the water block pools 
the heat away from the chip, cooling it. The heated fluid is pumped to the radiator, where fans 
expose it to cold air. The re-cooled fluid is then returned to the water block to be heated, and the 
cycle repeats. Sometimes liquid cooling is a necessity. PCs used for high-end gaming and places 
with high ambient temperatures require augmented cooling measures. Liquid-based cooling 
methods help in these cases.

Identifying Ports and Connectors

Welcome to Identifying Ports and Connectors.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define a port and a connector.
Differentiate between a port and an interface.
Identify common ports and connectors.
Devices connect to a computer using ports and connectors.
A port is a hole or a slot that receives a connector and allows a device to
physically connect to a computer.
A connector is the distinctive plug at the end of a cable, jack, or electronic
card that can be physically plugged into a port.
Each port has a unique function and accepts only the connector designed specifically to
fit into it.
Common examples of physical ports and connector pairs include the USB port, HDMI
port, Display port, and Speaker port.
An interface is the point of communication between two or more entities.
An interface can be either hardware or software-based.
Examples of hardware-based interfaces include the point where a port or card connects
to the computer motherboard, the point where a peripheral device connects to the computer,
or a touchscreen device that records human inputs.
Software interfaces provide routes for communication between software applications,
the operating system, and hardware.
For example, drivers are software interfaces that enable communication between the operating
system and the computer's hardware components.
Let's take a deeper look and learn to identify commonly used interfaces and connectors.
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) was built by a O of seven companies to replace
the many varieties of connectors available in the market with a common, simple-to-use,
and fast standard that could be used across devices and peripherals.
Since its launch in 1996, the USB connector has gone through several iterations.
When USB was first launched, it supported speeds of 1.5 to 12 mBits/second.
It also supported four different connector types: Type A, Type B, Mini A, and Mini B.
USB 2 was launched in 2001 to increase data transfer speeds up to 480 mBits/second.
It also added support for the Mini AB connector, and introduced the Micro A, Micro B, and Micro
AB connectors.
The USB 3 series of updates saw speeds increase to 5 Gbits/second with USB
3.0 in 2008.
The Type C connector was launched with USB 3.1 in 2014 with speeds of 10 Gbits/second.
It was made backward compatible with all versions of USB up to USB 2.
USB 3.2 was released in 2017 with speeds of 20 Gbits/second.
The Mini connector types were discontinued in this version.
USB 4 based on the Thunderbolt 3 and 4 protocol specifications was released
in 2019 and continues to be the latest and greatest version for USB devices.
It supports speeds of up to 40 Gbits/second over a Type C connector.
The Type A USB port has an elongated rectangle shape with four pins and carries
both data and power.
It is typically used for keyboards and mice.
The Type B port is almost square with beveled outside top corners.
These also have four pins and are mostly used with printers, scanners, and similar devices.
Mini USB ports were introduced for use with smaller devices such as digital cameras,
mobile phones, and tablets.
They have nine pins and are smaller than Type A or B, and twice as thick as Micro USB ports.
Micro USB ports are a similar width as Mini USB, but much thinner with only five
pins.
These were designed to replace Mini ports on smaller devices.
Finally, the 24-pin Type C with a reversible connector is designed to be future
proof and to replace various Type A and B connectors.
Thunderbolt is a commonly used hardware interface developed by Intel and Apple.
It was originally marketed under the name "Light Peak" but was later renamed to
Thunderbolt.
The Thunderbolt interface is very versatile, combining data transfer, display,
and power into one cable.
It allows up to six peripheral devices to be connected through a daisy chain.
Thunderbolt interfaces have four versions.
Versions 1 and 2 use the same connectors as a Mini DisplayPort or MDP.
Versions 3 and 4 reuse the USB-C connector.
While Thunderbolt 3 doubled the data transfer rate to 40 Gbit/second, Thunderbolt 4 has support
for USB-4 protocol and data rates, dual-4K displays,
and also supports Thunderbolt Alternate Hubs USB and not just daisy chaining.
All Thunderbolt ports are identified using the Thunderbolt symbol to differentiate
them from regular MDP and USB-C ports.
Before Thunderbolt, FireWire was a popular interface on Macintosh computers
and is comparable to the modern USB interface.
It comes in various shapes, the 400 is a slimmer connector with one rounded side and the faster
800 connector looks like a thicker version of the USB.
FireWire ports use a serial bus architecture to transfer information one bit
at a time.
This makes them lighter and cheaper than parallel buses that use a number of different physical
connections.
FireWire interfaces have been replaced with Thunderbolt and USB interfaces on modern
computers.
However, users with older computers, as well as the automobile and aerospace industries
still use these ports.
PS/2 ports were developed by IBM for their IBM Personal System 2 series of
computers and are named after them.
They are round and have six pins for connectivity.
These ports were specifically designed to connect the keyboard and mouse to the computer.
Although the two PS/2 ports look identical, they are not interchangeable, and
they are identified by different colors and symbols.
Although the PS/2 port is considered a legacy port, modern PCs may still carry
them as they are preferred by gaming enthusiasts, legacy users, and industrial applications.
eSATA is the most popular port to connect external storage devices such as external
hard drives to computers.
eSATA allows hot swapping, which is the replacement or addition of external
devices without stopping, shutting down, or rebooting the host system.
Since 2008, eSATA has been upgraded to the eSATAp interface that allows for both
eSATA and USB devices to be connected through the same port.
eSata has been through three main revisions and data transfer speeds have doubled
with each revision.
In this video you learned that:
A port is a hole or slot that receives a connector and allows a device to connect to a computer.
A connector is a plug at the end of a cable, jack, or electronic card that can be physically
plugged into a port.
An interface is a hardware- or software-based point of connection between two or more entities
that enables communication.
Common ports and connectors include PS/2, Thunderbolt, Firewire, eSATA, and USB.

An Introduction to Operating Systems 

Welcome to "An Introduction to Operating Systems."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe what an operating system is and describe the functions operating systems manage;
Classify types of operating systems; Describe operating system generations;
and describe the history of Linux, Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS operating systems.
Operating systems provide standardized backbone code for managing input, output, processing,
and storage.
These efforts help keep data error-free and mitigate data loss.
Operating systems can have more than one environment.
The first environment, the command line interface (or CLI), is an environment where the user
can type commands.
The second environment is known as a graphical user interface, or a graphic shell.
These environments provide menus, links, buttons, and fields that help users manage the operating
system.
History groups operating systems into four generations.
The first generation was from 1945 to 1955.
The second generation happened from 1955 to 1965.
The third generation lasted 15 years, from 1965 to 1980.
And, 1980 ushered in the fourth and current generation.
During the first generation of modern computing, from 1945 to 1955, operating systems that
worked for multiple computers did not yet exist.
Each computer's parameters were uniquely created for every job, or task, using machine
language.
However, some of the code developed during this era became the basis for future operating
systems.
During the second generation of operating systems, mainframe computers became available
for commercial and scientific use.
Tape drives, a relatively new invention, provided input and output storage.
In 1956, General Motors Research produced the first single-stream batch operating system,
notably for its IBM 704 computing system.
Subsequently, IBM became the first company to create operating systems to accompany computers.
Embedded operating systems, developed in the early 1960s and still in use, focus on a single
task, providing split-second response times, also known as low latency.
In case of a system error, these operating systems can restart where the task needs to
resume.
Real-time operating systems are a type of embedded operating system.
Airplanes, air traffic control systems, and space exploration were among the first to
use real-time operating systems.
As time passed, satellite systems, robotics, and even our cars implemented real-time operating
systems.
Then, during the third generation of operating system development, additional companies began
creating batch file operating systems specifically for their large computing needs.
This generation of operating systems saw the development of network operating systems that
provided scalable, fast, accurate, and secure network traffic and communications and enabled
each workstation within the network to operate independently.
In 1969, the UNIX operating system offered a new innovation, an operating system that
was installable on multiple computer systems and featured processor timesharing.
Processor timesharing enabled multiple users with different programs to interact nearly
simultaneously with a central computer, such as a mainframe.
The fourth and current generation of operating systems brought computing into a new age with
multitasking operating systems including Linux, Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS operating 
systems that enable computers to perform multiple, complex tasks simultaneously.
Mobile operating systems including Android, Windows, iOS, and ChromeOS (which is also
considered a mobile operating system), fit the definition of multitasking operating systems.
Let's learn more about some of these operating systems.
In 1991, Linus Torvalds created a small, open source operating system for a PC, releasing
version 1.0 of Linux in 1994.
In 1996, the version 2.0 release with support for network-based symmetric multiprocessing
(or SMP) provided a serious technical benefit for commercial and scientific data processing,
evolving Linux into a powerful network and server operating system.
Throughout the next 10 years, Linux gained market acceptance and its distributions continued
to mature.
In 2013, Google's Linux-based mobile operating system, Android, took 75% of the market share.
When evaluating the value of Linux, consider that in 2018, IBM acquired Red Hat for 34
billion US dollars.
The operating systems PC-DOS and MS-DOS once existed, with MS-DOS launching in 1981.
In 1985, Windows offered the consumer market a graphical user interface version of the
Windows operating system, written in variations of C language.
In 1995, the debut of Windows 95 catapulted Microsoft's dominance in the consumer operating
system software market, with Microsoft holding about 70% of the consumer desktop operating
system market share in 2021.
Microsoft also offers network, server management, mobile, and phone operating systems.
Apple, with its OS X and macOS based on Unix, began its foray into the operating system
market in 1999 with PowerPC-based Macs.
In 2006, Apple began selling Macs using Intel core processors.
In 2020, Apple began the Apple silicon chip transition, using self-designed, 64-bit, ARM-based
Apple M1 processors on new Mac computers.
Apple also offers the iOS operating system for its tablet and smartphone devices.
In 2011, Google debuted ChromeOS built atop Linux,
ChromeOS offers a lightweight operating system for mobile devices, including laptops
Laptops and tablets running ChromeOS require less local storage and cost less, making them
ideal for students, and this operating system is currently used by
about 10% of the laptop market.
In this video, you learned that: Operating systems provide standardized code
that eliminates the need to manually recreate all the possible code necessary for input,
processing, output and storage for every computer action.
In 1956, GM Research created the first operating system that is also credited as being the
first single-stream batch operating system.
Linux evolved into a powerful operating system for networks and servers.
With the creation of Windows 95, Microsoft began its domination of the consumer operating
system market.
And ChromeOS, built on top of Linux, is a lightweight, primarily browser-based operating
system.
Getting Started with Microsoft Windows

Welcome to "Getting Started with Microsoft Windows 10."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify four Windows login methods.
Describe how to use the Windows desktop.
Explain how to find the Settings app.
Explain how to resize windows and switch programs, and
identify Windows keyboard shortcut commands.
Microsoft Windows 10 provides four easy methods to log into a machine,
You can log in using a PIN,
a password
by drawing over a photo that you previously set up, or
by scanning the fingerprint that you previously paired with the computer.
Next, let's check out parts of the Windows desktop.
Click the Windows icon to view the Start menu and Productivity pane.
On the left side of the Start menu, you can see which user is logged on, and shortcuts
to documents, pictures, settings, and power management options. Available programs are
organized alphabetically. If you right-click a program's icon, you
see menu options to uninstall the program, pin the program to your Taskbar, run the program
with administrator rights, and open its file location.
To the right of the Start menu is the Productivity pane, which consists of a mixture of live
and static tiles.
Static tiles are shortcuts to favorite and frequently used programs.
Live tiles provide a quick view of information such as news, weather, and sports.
Right-click any tile to remove the tile, uninstall the program, or perform other tasks.
At the bottom of the screen, the Windows Taskbar provides access to the Windows Start button,
where you can open the Start menu.
Next is the Taskbar Search box, where you can search for files, settings, and programs
on the computer or perform a quick web search.

Features and Functions of an Operating 
System


Welcome to features and functions of an operating system.
After watching this video, you will be able to explain how to install and
set up a Windows 10 operating system,
describe essential workstation management tasks, describe the purpose of drivers and
how to update that them and identify five useful Windows utilities.
How are operating systems installed on a computer?
Usually, the computer manufacturer loads, installs and
partially preconfigures the operating system.
However, in corporate environments,
IT support installs operating systems on both new and reconfigured computers.
If you are self installing the Windows operating system from an external drive,
first attach the external drive that contains the installer version of
the operating system to the computer.
When you start the computer, the basic input output system,
known as the BIOS displays select the boot option that uses the external drive
where you attach the drive containing the operating system software.
Save your BIOS changes.
The computer should automatically restart.
Follow the installer processes if the computer manufacturer preinstalled
the operating system.
Many options are pre configured.
Follow the prompts to activate the Microsoft operating system.
Select the operating system version.
Select the target installation drive.
Select your region, specify your keyboard type and
create or connect your Microsoft account, ID and password.
Continue following the prompts and select three security questions.
Decide if you want to connect with Cortana, Microsoft's onboard assistant.
Select the option to sync your device history and accept your privacy settings,
which is part of creating system security.
With most of your configuration tasks completed,
follow the prompts to update Windows.
Next, select the BitLocker option to encrypt the local hard drive.
Encryption is an important data privacy and security capability.
Your machine may restart several times during the configuration process.
Policy Management applies rules for passwords, password retries
allowed programs, and other settings specific to the machine or group.
Here's how to access policy management.
Type Group Policy in the Taskbar search box,
the Edit Group Policy Control Panel option displays click Open, select
the user configuration settings to view its details, and edit policy settings.
Windows automatically schedules processes and allocates resources,
most of the time uneventfully.
Sometimes, though, a task might stall and you need to end the task and
stop the process.
Open Windows Task Manager to view apps and their background processes.
When you locate the troublesome software or
process, select End Task to stop the process.
Perhaps you want to verify the installation and performance of a new hard
drive, or that the computer recognizes memory or recognizes another computer
component, such as an addon card, which includes interfaces.
In the windows Taskbar field Type Device Manager Select open to
launch the Device Manager app.
Scroll the list and you'll see the computer's hardware components and
interfaces such as the Intel Management Engine interface number one.
Double click to view the interface's properties.
Here on the General tab, you can confirm that the interface is working properly.
You can also view events, evaluate resources,
set power management options, update driver Software,
which works with the computer for external capabilities update Firmware,
which is onboard device software and view additional device details.
Windows uses RAM for frequent memory tasks and virtual memory for
less frequent tasks.
If the computer's performance is slow or
the computer is displaying low on virtual memory errors, it's time to take action.
To evaluate memory performance based on the installed Ram hardware,
open Task Manager and view the memory resource usage.
If needed run the Windows memory diagnostic.
Sometimes an installed program needs more virtual memory.
To manage virtual memory, select Settings and about,
then begin typing the Word Performance.
Select the option to adjust the appearance and performance of Windows.
The Performance Options window displays in the virtual memory section, select Change.
In most instances, Windows automatically adjusts virtual memory.
If you do find that you need to adjust virtual memory, such as for
a memory intensive application, this is the Windows operating system location
where you can adjust those settings.
Service management automatically handles background tasks.
However, sometimes a program just won't close.
Or perhaps you see a program using so much memory that other programs can't run.
Service management enables you to troubleshoot and manage these situations.
Capabilities include stopping the service, restarting the service,
running a program, taking no action, and restarting the computer.
Drivers are software components that enable communications between
the operating system and the device.
If a device suddenly stops working, aside from a power issue or
other hardware issue, it's possible that the driver is outdated.
Perhaps a printer suddenly stopped working because the printer needs a new driver to
communicate with the computer.
To update or configure a new driver, access Windows Device Manager.
Locate your device and right click to view the device's details.
If needed, select Update Driver.
Utilities help you administer and manage the operating system.
Windows Diagnostics locates hardware memory errors.
Windows Performance Monitor provides performance details for processes,
applications and hardware.
Windows Event Viewer provides detailed activity logs to diagnose errors,
installation problems, and other issues.
Windows Registry Editor enables the correction of embedded software
registration information, such as the disk location for a program's files.
And Windows Task Manager enables the viewing and management of machine tasks
that help you troubleshoot errors and enhance performance.
In this video, you learned that you can use the external media to
install Windows if Windows is not preinstalled.
Policy management decisions enhance security.
Windows Device Manager helps you verify that computer devices, components and
interfaces are working correctly.
You also learned that service management automatically manages background tasks and
enables advanced troubleshooting of performance issues.
And five useful windows utilities include Memory Diagnostics,
Performance Manager, Event Viewer, Registry Editor and Task Manager.

Resolution
A digital image is made up of many thousands of picture elements (pixels). 
Resolution describes the number of dots an imaging device can use to 
sample or display the image, measured in pixels per inch (PPI). The higher 
the resolution, the better the quality. On a digital printer, the resolution is 
the number of toner or ink dots that the print engine can put on paper 
(measured in dots per inch [dpi]). Note that sometimes dpi is used 
interchangeably with PPI to describe scanner or monitor resolution. Still, 
image pixels and printer dots are not equivalent, as multiple printer dots are 
required to represent a single image pixel accurately.
Router
Routers connect similar and dissimilar networks at network layer three 
within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Routers can access 
multiple source and destination addresses within packets based on speed, 
traffic loads, and costs. They can keep track of multiple active paths within 
a source and destination network. Network administrators can use TCP/IP 
routers on a local area network to divide the network into logical subnets.

Commercial and Open Source Software 

Welcome to "Commercial and Open Source Software."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define commercial software.
Define open source software.
And identify differences between commercial and open source software.
What is commercial software?
Commercial software, also sometimes referred to as proprietary or closed source, is copyrighted 
software.
When individuals or companies purchase the software, they must acknowledge the software 
developer's copyright, which is identified in the End-User License Agreement or EULA.
Commercial software source code is private, and users are prohibited from copying, modifying, or 
redistributing the software or any part of the source code, except parts of the source code that may 
be open source.
It is usually developed for commercial profit and can include open source code bundled with private 
source code.
When commercial software is installed, a product key or a serial number is issued to certify that the 
software is original.
Some commercial software is free, but upgrades and updates may cost extra, or the software may 
contain ads.
Some examples of commercial software are: Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, and Intuit 
QuickBooks.
Software licenses are also required for most open source software.
Open source is also referred to as free and open source or FOSS, Open source software is free, and 
can be downloaded, installed, and used without limits or restrictions. Note that free software is not 
always the same as freeware, which is free to users, but is not always open source.
Open source software contains free source code, which can be freely copied, modified, and 
redistributed.
It also gives developers and users open access to the functions of the software and source code 
without cost or restrictions.
A benefit of open source software is that developers and users can contribute to the source code and 
work together to improve the software and its functionality.
Even though open source software is free and open, users are still required to agree to an End-User 
License Agreement or EULA in order to use the software.
Some examples of open source software are: Linux, Mozilla Firefox, and Apache OpenOffice.
There are some important differences in open source and closed source software.
With open source software, the source code is available to be edited, modified, and redistributed.
Users don't have to pay to download, install, or use the software.
Open source code can sometimes be used in commercial software,
which is usually developed for profit, but can also include freeware.
With closed source software, developers keep private the source code and how it works.
Additionally, with closed source, a company or individual owns the rights to the source code and 
software, like with the Microsoft Edge web browser.
Freeware, like the Edge browser, and commercial software can be closed source, regardless of 
whether it is available for free or for purchase.
The Chromium web browser is an example of open source software, and the source code is free and 
openly available to everyone.
The basis for the code in the Microsoft Edge web browser is from the open source code in
the Chromium web browser. While some of the source code in Edge is open source, most of the 
source code is closed source and proprietary.
The Microsoft Windows OS is both closed source and commercial, and users pay for the software.
Note that for all software, whether it is open source or closed source, anyone who wants to use the 
software must agree to the End-User License Agreement.
So how can you tell the difference between open source and closed source software?
Most software has an "About" section located in the details of the software.
If there isn't an "About" section, look for "details" or some terms that are similar.
In this example from the Microsoft Edge web browser, you would select the three dots in the right 
corner.
Next, from the list, you would select "Help and feedback" to open more options.
Then you would select "About Microsoft Edge" for more details.
So how do you know if the application is open source or closed source?
Once you select "About Microsoft Edge" the details show that Microsoft Edge uses Chromium 
open source code and other open source software.
While the steps for determining open source or closed source will not be the same for every 
application, you can follow similar steps to find more information, or you can search trusted 
websites for more information about source codes for most software.
In this video, you learned that:
Commercial software is also known as proprietary or closed source software.
Commercial software is copyrighted software.
Individuals and companies can purchase commercial software as long as they comply with the 
specified conditions listed in the software license.
Commercial software contains private source code that is often not accessible to users and 
competing companies.
Users may not copy, modify, or redistribute private source code from commercial software.
Additionally, you learned that:
Open source software is also known as free and open source software or FOSS, and it can be 
downloaded, installed, and used without limits or restrictions.
The source code in open source software is free and can be copied, modified, and redistributed.
Users and developers have open access to the software functions and source code.
There is overlap between open source and commercial software because open
source code can be used in commercial software.
All open source software is available for free, and some commercial software can be available for 
free.
And finally, you can find out whether software is open source or closed source in the "About" 
details of the application or program.


Reading: Software Licenses

A software license states the terms and conditions for software providers and users. It is a contract 
between the developer or group who created the source code and the software's end user. The 
license specifies who owns the software, outlines copyrights for the software, and specifies the 
terms and duration of the license. It states where the user can install the software, how many 
copies they can install, and how to use it. A software license can be lengthy and full of definitions, 
restrictions, and penalties for misuse.
Agreeing to the licensing terms is required for the use of most software. To install and use 
software, you must agree to the terms and requirements of an End-User License Agreement, 
or EULA.
Types of Software Licenses
Different software programs and applications have various ways of presenting their EULAs. Let's 
look at some common examples of types of licenses:
•	Single-use licenses allow a single installation on one computer or, depending on the 
software, the license may allow a single user to install the software on any machines that 
belong to the user.
•	A group use, corporate, campus, or site license allows multiple installations for a 
specified number of users. It also allows installation on many computers or devices. This 
license is ideal for use with computers and devices registered to a group, such as a computer 
lab on a college campus or a writing team at a newspaper.
•	Concurrent licenses allow installation on many computers, but they can only be used 
concurrently, meaning at the same time by a lower number of users. Concurrent licenses 
are ideal for companies that do not have all workers using the software simultaneously, such 
as nurses and doctors who work different shifts.
•	Open-source licenses, free and open source (FOSS), are necessary for open-source 
software to protect developers and contributors. An open-source license means the user can 
access free software, which the user can download, install, and use without limitations or 
restrictions. The user also gets the source code for free, which can be freely copied, 
modified, and redistributed. Despite no limits or restrictions, open-source software requires 
users to sign a licensing agreement.
•	Proprietary software licenses are more restrictive than FOSS and aim to protect the 
developers and the companies who own the software. These licenses cover copyrighted 
software with specified conditions listed in the license. Proprietary licenses also protect 
private source code, which users cannot copy, modify, or redistribute. Users are required to 
sign a EULA.
Costs
Software license costs vary depending on the type of software, how an organization or person will 
use it, and how much developers spent to develop the software. Remember that the cost is for the 
software license, which allows you to use the software. Several options are available, such as 
trial, subscription, and one-time purchase.
•	Trial licenses are available for free and for a limited time to allow users to decide if they 
like it and want to purchase the software.
•	Subscription licenses require recurring payments, and users are billed regularly on a set 
schedule, such as monthly or yearly. Software developers and companies often prefer 
subscription-based models because they generate more income and allow developers and 
companies to control the cost and updates for the software licenses. Users can access 
subscription-based licensed software offline, but online access is needed occasionally for 
updates and upgrades. Also, online access allows users to verify with the vendor that the 
subscription is still active. Users can access the software for a limited time if their 
subscription is valid.
•	A one-time purchase of a software license allows the user to pay just once for the 
software and to use the application or program without interruption for the life of the 
software. However, a drawback to a one-time purchase is that updates or upgrades to the 
software may not be available. The user will need to purchase newer versions or upgrades 
separately.
Product Keys
To ensure your software is licensed, developers and vendors will issue a product key when the 
software is purchased. Product keys are unique, long sequences of numbers that certify that the 
copy of the software is original. Product keys are usually included on a physical copy of the 
software or sent through email when downloaded. Some programs and applications automatically 
register the product key when you install the application. For subscription software licenses, 
companies may use serial numbers or license IDs. When software is activated, the product key is 
locked to a specific computer, which helps prevent software piracy.

Software Versions

Welcome to Software Versions.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Discuss software versions on computing platforms
and identify software versions and numbering.
Software versions tell us a lot about programs and applications.
Users can determine what software version they are using, and developers can provide
useful information with version numbers.
Software version numbers vary in length and meaning; however, most version numbers follow
a similar format and represent similar information.
Version numbers indicate when the software was released, when it was updated, and if
any minor changes or patches were made to the software.
Software versioning is how software developers keep track of new software, updates, and patches
for programs and applications.
Version numbers can be displayed in several ways.
Version numbers can be short or long, depending on the software and the preference of the
developer, with 2, 3, or 4 number sets.
Each number set is divided by a period.
The first release of an application or program might have a 1.0 as the version number to
indicate no updates, patches, or fixes to the software.
Note: A version still in beta or testing could have a version number lower than 1, such as
0.9.
A program or application with many releases and updates will have a longer number, sometimes
4 different number sets within the version number
Some software developers may use dates for their versioning.
For example: Ubuntu Linux version 18.04.2 was released in 2018 April.
The third number set, point-2, designates an additional change or update.
What do these numbers mean?
Some version numbers follow the semantic numbering system and have 4 parts separated by a 
period,
but not all numbering systems follow this 4-part example.
In semantic numbering , the first number indicates major changes to the software, such as a new
release.
The second number indicates that minor changes were made to the software.
The third number in the version number indicates patches or minor bug fixes.
Finally, the fourth number indicates a build number or a build date, and it can indicate
less significant changes made.
Software version numbers are identified in the About or Help section of software.
You can practice identifying your version number in a web browser.
This example illustrates how to view the version number in the Google Chrome desktop web 
browser;
however, if you are using a different web browser, you should be able to follow the
same or similar steps.
To view the browser version:
First, select the three dots or three lines in the top-right corner of your browser.
Next, select the menu item "Help."
Then, select "About" to view the version information.
The version of your web browser will display.
Are newer versions of software compatible with older versions?
Lack of compatibility between old and new versions of software is a common problem.
You can troubleshoot compatibility issues by viewing the software version to determine
if you are using an outdated version of the software.
Sometimes updating software to a newer version will resolve compatibility issues.
Some software is backwards compatible.
If a program or application is backwards compatible, then the older versions of files, programs,
and systems will work properly with newer versions.
In this video, you learned that:
Version numbers indicate the history of changes, updates, and patches to software,
Some version numbers follow the semantic numbering system and have 4 parts separated by a 
period,
Compatibility with old and new versions of software is a common problem,
and you should view the version of the software you are using to determine software compatibility.

Reading: File Formats and Productivity and 
Collaboration Software

File Formats
Understanding the format of a file helps you determine which application is needed to open or 
run the file. You can identify the file format quickly by the file extension. File extensions have a 
period followed by a three- or four-letter extension or suffix. The extension, which appears after the 
filename, tells the operating system which applications will run the files. In Microsoft Windows 
applications, the extension usually indicates what application will run the file and the file type, such 
as executable, compressed, or image.
Some standard file formats are:
•	Executable files
•	Compression files
•	Audio and video files, also known as media files.
•	Image files
•	Document files
Executable files run programs and applications. The executables may be part of the operating 
system, an installation package, or an application. Familiarizing yourself with the executable file 
types is essential to understand what will run on your computer. Some executable file formats and 
extensions are as follows:
•	EXEs are MS Windows applications that may have several files with them that help them 
run on the computer.
•	BAT files are batch files or scripts and include a list of commands the computer must 
execute sequentially.
•	SH files run shell commands and scripts executable on Linux / Unix, equivalent to MS 
Windows BAT files.
•	CMD are command files for MS Windows. They are also script files and contain commands 
that the system completes in order. They are like BAT files.
•	APP files are a type of Mac application bundle.
•	MSI files are installer packages in MS Windows.
Compressed formats, also called compression formats, combine files to save disk space. The most 
popular compression format in MS Windows is ZIP, and people often discuss file compression as 
"zipping" files or as "zipped" folders. Standard compressed formats are as follows:
•	ZIP or ZIPX is a compression format for MS Windows computers.
•	7-ZIP or 7z is used for the 7-Zip archiver.
•	GZIP or GZ is the default format for the GZIP compression utility.
•	ISO is a file system that uses writeable CDs, DVDs, or USB flash drives to create an optical 
disc image.
•	JAR is a format for compressing Java class files and data.
•	RAR is a format for the WinRAR file archive program.
•	TAR is a tape archive.
Audio and video formats are media files that can contain sound recordings, video recordings, or 
both. Audio files such as voice recordings, podcasts, music, and audiobooks are saved in audio 
formats. Video files such as movies, TV shows, presentations, and music videos are saved in video 
formats. Different media players support other media format files, so knowing which format you 
have is essential. Audio and video formats are sometimes listed together and share the same 
extensions. This is because they often share the same properties or have both video and audio data 
in them. Common audio files include:
•	WAV
•	MPEG, which includes MP3 and MP4 file types.
•	AAC
•	MIDI
Common video files include:
•	AVI
•	FLV
•	MPEG, which includes MP4 and MPG
•	WMV
Images, photos, digital paintings, and pictures can be stored as image files. While these are not all 
the image formats, these are the most common:
•	The BMP format is older, but it is not used as often due to the large file size.
•	The GIF format can store and cycle through several graphics in one file.
•	JPG/JPEG have smaller file sizes, but also have lower image quality.
•	PNG has higher image quality than its predecessor GIF.
•	TIFF/TIF saves images in a high-quality format, but the images have a larger file size.
Files that rely primarily on text are saved as document files. Some document formats are as follows:
•	TXT or text files are plain text with no formatting.
•	RTF, or Rich Text Format, is a common word processing format used by most word 
applications. It includes basic text formatting, headers and footers, and margins.
•	DOCX and DOC are used for Microsoft Word documents.
•	XLSX and XLS are file formats for Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet application.
•	Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader primarily use PDF format. This format preserves 
document formatting so that no matter what device you open the file in, the file will look the 
same.
•	PPTX and PPT formats are used for creating PowerPoint slides and presentation decks.
Productivity and Collaboration Software
There are four main types of software: productivity, business, collaboration, and utility. 
Software applications are installed from a disc or flash drive or downloaded from the Internet and 
then activated using the product key.
Productivity softwares are programs and applications that people frequently use to help 
manage activities and complete daily tasks. It is important to note that programs or applications 
can be categorized as multiple types of software. For example, most business software also falls 
into the productivity and collaboration software types.

Software Installation Management

Welcome to Software Installation Management.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Discuss installing and uninstalling software on various computing platforms, and identify software 
installing and uninstalling best practices.
Consider the following before installing software:
Read the application details and be selective about what you're installing.
Be aware that some software may also install ads or other unwanted software.
Avoid downloading software that contains malware designed to steal personal information on your
device, encrypt your files, require you to pay a ransom for decryption, or monitor your device.
Review permission requests to access other apps and hardware on your device.
And be selective when allowing application privileges to items such as your device's camera, 
contact lists, location data, and similar sensitive information.
Before installing software, you should consider what will work best with your project and what will 
work optimally on your device.
You should consider minimum system requirements, such as:
Minimum processor speed.
Minimum amount of RAM.
The minimum amount of hard disk space available.
And compatible operating system versions.
Additional requirements may be:
A specific display adapter.
The amount of display adapter RAM.
And an Internet connection to use the software.
Windows desktop software will usually have an installer.
To install software from physical media, such as a USB or CD,
insert the disk or drive and wait for a prompt to run the installer.
Sometimes, the installer will run automatically.
If the installer does not start automatically, browse the file system for the software, locate the 
installer, usually an EXE or MSI file, and then double-click to start the installer program.
When installation is complete, the application should start.
You can also download and install software for Windows.
Software downloads are available through Windows-compatible websites or from the Microsoft 
Store.
When installing software from a website, be sure to verify that the site is trustworthy and read
installation prompts. Do not install any software from a site that looks suspicious.
Many installers, when started, will automatically begin installing the program or will guide you 
through the installation process.
And programs available for download are available as compressed files, EXE files, or ISO files.
You can also install software from a disc in macOS.
To install software from a disc:
Insert the disc in the computer, and the setup utility should start automatically.
If setup does not start, you can use Finder to browse for the disc to start the setup.
In Finder, locate the setup file.
And to start the setup, select the file and then follow any prompts.
To install macOS software that you have downloaded from online:
Open the downloaded file and then follow the installation prompts.
Locate the file you have downloaded, which may sometimes appear in the bottom corner of your 
browser after the download is complete.
If you did not download the software from the Apple app store, you might receive an alert that says 
the application cannot be opened.
If you're sure the software is safe, then select Open to continue the software installation.
Mac installation files have several different file formats including ZIP, PKG, and DMG.
For a ZIP file, double-click the file to install it into its own folder.
Within that folder, you will find a PKG or DMG file.
PKG files will install the software automatically.
And DMG files may need to be moved into the Applications folder.
Most operating systems have their own online store from which you can download and install 
programs.
In the vendor's store, you can browse for applications, select one, and then select Install.
And the application will start downloading from the online store.
Be sure to read the prompts from your device before uninstalling any programs and applications.
Here are some reasons you might want to uninstall software:
The software slows down your device, The software version on your device is outdated, or
there is not enough available storage space on your device.
Follow these steps to uninstall software in Windows:
Navigate to Settings on your computer, and then select Apps.
From the Apps & features list, select the application, and then select Uninstall.
And if prompted, verify that you want to uninstall the program.
If you are using a more modern version of the Windows OS, such as Windows 10, you can uninstall 
a program or application from the Start menu by:
Selecting the app tile, and Selecting Uninstall from the menu.
Be sure to read any warning messages or prompts about uninstalling software.
Steps for uninstalling software on macOS devices depend on which version of macOS you are 
using.
However, most uninstalling processes require the same or similar steps.
To uninstall software in macOS:
Move the file or icon from the Applications folder to the Trash, which is located on the Dock.
And be sure to empty the Trash to make sure the application is removed.

In this video, you learned that:
You should read the application details and be selective about what you're installing.
You should view your minimum system requirements to determine which software and versions 
will work best for your project and what software will work optimally on your device.
The process for installing software varies depending on your devices and operating systems.
You should read and follow the setup instructions when installing new software.
And for some software, you might need to perform several steps before uninstalling the software;
for most modern software, you might only need to select the app and then uninstall.

Common Web Browsers

Welcome to Common Web Browsers.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify common web browsers and
identify the components of a web browser.
A web browser is the software interface that accesses resources on the Internet including
text, images, music, video, and online games.
As an Internet user, you use a browser to request access to web pages on various websites
and it's the browser's job to request and retrieve that web-based content stored
on a web server,
and display that content on web pages in the browser window on your device.
You can use a web browser on several different types of devices including desktop PCs, laptops,
notebooks, tablets, smartphones, game consoles, and even smaller, wearable tech devices such
as smart watches.
It is estimated that in 2021 just over 5 billion people around the world used some type of
web browser.
According to statistical information provided by Statcounter Global Stats, as of October
2021, the most commonly used web browsers, according to worldwide market share across
all platforms, are:
Chrome by Google, which has approximately 65% of the market share,
Safari by Apple, which has around 19% market share,
Edge by Microsoft, which has just under 4% market share, which is closely followed by
Firefox by Mozilla, which has an approximate market share of just over 3.6%,
the Samsung Internet browser, which has just under a 3% share, and finally,
the Opera browser, which has just over 2.3% share of the web browser market.
Apart from these six most popular web browsers, there are several other alternative browsers
that you could use instead.
This table summarizes which browsers each operating system supports.
Note that most web browsers can be used on any platform, but there are cases where the
browser can only be used on a restricted set of operating system platforms,
such as Apple's Safari browser, which can only be used on the macOS and iOS operating
systems.
And similarly, the Samsung Internet browser can only be used on Samsung Galaxy devices
running Android 5.0 or later.
A typical web browser is made up of various components.
The user interface is where the user uses common UI elements such as a search bar and
an address bar to enter a Uniform Resource Locator (or URL) to search for content on
the web.
It includes navigation tools such as Home, Back, Forward and Refresh buttons, along with
other features such as History, Bookmarks, and Favorites to visit previously viewed pages
or save links to web pages for later reference.
The browser engine is the piece of code that is responsible for querying and controlling
the rendering engine in the layer below it, based on user interactions coming from the
user interface layer above it, such as requests to load the URL and back and forward navigation
when browsing.
The rendering engine is responsible for presenting (or rendering) the requested web pages and
content on your browser screen.
Primarily it interprets the HyperText Markup Language (or HTML) code, XML documents, and
images and presents them in an easily digestible format on your browser screen. Ted

The rendering engine can also display other kinds of data by virtue of plugins or extensions.
The Networking component retrieves the entered URLs by using Internet communication protocols;
namely HyperText Transfer Protocol (or HTTP) and File Transfer Protocol (or FTP).
This component is also responsible for handling a cache of recently retrieved content, which
it can re-issue when requested.
This reduces network traffic by eliminating the need to constantly retrieve files from
a web source that have been previously retrieved and have not changed since that last retrieval
instance.
The JavaScript interpreter, as the name suggests, interprets and executes any JavaScript code
embedded in viewed websites.
The interpreted results are directed to the rendering engine to be rendered on your browser
screen.
The user interface (or UI) backend is responsible for drawing basic widgets, such as windows
and combo boxes, by using underlying operating system UI methods to expose a generic interface
that is not platform specific or dependent.
And lastly, there is the data persistence, or data storage, component, which is essentially
a small database located on the local device that stores user data such as cache, session
storage, cookies, bookmarks, and user profile preferences.
These components work together to give a web browser its core functionality.
In this video, you learned that:
A web browser is the software interface to access resources on the Internet including
text, images, music, video, and online games.
You can use a web browser from desktop PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, game consoles,
and wearable tech devices such as smart watches.
The six most widely used web browsers are Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox, Samsung Internet,
and Opera.
Most web browsers can be used on any platform, but some can only be used on a restricted
set of operating system platforms.
And finally, web browsers consist of several integrated software components.

Browser Installs and Updates

Welcome to "Browser Installs and Updates."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify how to obtain web browsers and
understand the need for web browser updates.
So, how do you obtain a web browser?
Well, there are really two options; it will either be provided as part of an operating system,
as is the case with Microsoft Edge on the Windows operating system,
Safari on Apple devices, and Samsung Internet on Android devices.
Alternatively, and, in addition,
you can download a web browser from a vendor's website or app store;
but of course, for that you will first need a web browser to initially browse to the site or store.
There is a huge amount of debate about which browser is better than the other,
which is more secure than the other, which performs faster than the other, and so on.
But as these web browsers are all free to obtain and use,
you are also free to make your own decision about which one, or more, best suits your needs.
So, there is absolutely nothing wrong,
or uncommon, with having several different web browsers installed and running on your device.
In any case, you will likely be asked by the operating system at some point
to define your 'default' browser, and this is the one the operating system will
automatically use when you click a link in an app or an email, for example.
You are probably already aware that it is important to keep your operating system
and software applications up to date. Well, the same is true for your web browsers, too.
Here are some key reasons for keeping your web browsers updated:
Compatibility with websites - As new web-based technologies emerge,
websites start to use them and therefore web browsers need to be improved and updated
to support those new technologies. Any older versions of browsers that have not been updated
may not be able to display or use some areas or features of a website.
Security - If you don't keep your web browser updated to its latest version it can lead
to security vulnerabilities that expose your browser to the possibility of being compromised
by some form of malicious software attack such as a virus, keylogger,
or spyware. These attacks can lead to the leakage of personal and/or financial information.
New features - As developers add new or improved features to their browser software
or just generally improve its performance,
your web browsers need to be updated to gain the benefits those improvements provide.
Most of the top desktop web browsers provide standard
fast-release updates at the same release rate,
which typically releases major updates every four weeks
but releases minor updates, such as security fixes, crash fixes,
and updates to policies on an as- needed basis within the four-week period.
This is currently the case for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Mozilla Firefox browsers.
Aside from this standard fast-release update frequency, some vendors also
offer an extended release for updates, which provides updates at a much-reduced frequency
to help more structured environments, such as large corporations, educational establishments,
and government departments maintain browser stability over a longer period.
Regardless of which flavors of web browser you use, updating them is relatively quick and simple.
Most browsers have an 'automatic updates' option that is often the default setting,
which typically checks for updates every hour or so and on every browser restart.
However, if needed, you can manually initiate a browser update, too.
For example, in Google Chrome, you select the Customize
and control Google Chrome icon in the top-right corner of the browser window,
point to Help,
and then select About Google Chrome.
Chrome will check for any available updates and download and install them.
In Mozilla Firefox, click the Open Application Menu icon
in the top-right corner of the browser window,
then click Help,
and then click About Firefox to check for updates.
Firefox will check for any available updates, and you restart the browser to install the updates.
In Microsoft Edge, click the Settings and more icon
in the top-right corner of the browser window,
then point to Help and feedback,
and then click About Microsoft Edge.
Edge will check for any available updates, and download and install them.
Once the update has been downloaded,
you will need to restart Edge in order to complete the update process.
Devices that run macOS regularly and automatically check for updates
to the Safari browser (and any other software installed) via the App Store,
and will prompt you to install updates as and when they are discovered,
using on-screen notifications.
In the App Store, you can either update Safari alongside other applications as
part of a single mass update process, or you can check for Safari updates only.
If you want to manually check for and install updates to Safari only,
select the Apple logo icon in the top-left corner of the window,
point to App Store,
and then select the Updates tab.
On the Updates tab, next to Software Update, select the More link. This will expand the
System Applications list and enable you to select Safari from the list of applications.
Next to the Safari version number, select UPDATE.
And the latest available version of Safari will then download and install.
In this video, you learned that:
Web browsers can be obtained as part of an operating system or via a download.
The key reasons for keeping your web browsers updated
are website compatibility, security, and new features.
The top desktop web browsers provide major updates every four weeks,
and minor updates on an as-needed basis within the four weeks.
Web browsers usually update automatically, but you can also update them manually if required.

Interpreted and Compiled Programming 
Languages

Welcome to interpreted and compiled programming languages!
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify interpreted programming languages,
and identify compiled programming languages.
What are programming languages?
Programming languages help us tell computers what to do.
Computers don't use human language; they use their own language, called machine code.
Machines understand binary code, that is 1s and 0s.
So, to make communicating with computers easier, we have human-readable programming 
languages.
Two common categories for programming languages are:
Interpreted and compiled.
These are broad categories, and there are many programming languages that are classified
under compiled languages and interpreted languages.
The purpose of the project helps a developer determine which programming language is best.
Interpreted language is also commonly referred to as scripted or scripting language.
Programs written in interpreted or scripted language, like Python and HTML, run through
the programming interpreter on your computer's operating system or in your web browser.
Remember that programming languages are in human-readable code, so, the interpreter takes the 
human-readable scripted code and then translates it into machine code, enabling the computer to 
complete the requested task.
As computers and web pages have changed and advanced, some interpreted programming 
languages are outdated, and they are not as useful or relevant.
Some other languages are more versatile and easier to learn, which means they are preferred over 
other scripting languages and used more often.
All interpreted programming languages need an interpreter to translate the source code.
Translators are built into your web browser or they require a program on your computer to translate 
the code.
Several different interpreted programming languages exist.
Some examples of common interpreted programming language types are:
• JavaScript, a simpler scripting language that runs through the web browser interpreter
• Python, a language that is popular because it is easy to learn and use for developers
• Lua, a general purpose, lightweight game scripting language that is easy to learn and
use
• HTML, a markup language used for formatting web pages
Another category of programming languages is the compiled programming languages.
Compiled programs are applications and programs, like your music app or your operating 
system,
that you run on your computer or device.
The programs are packaged --or compiled-- into one executable file.
They are usually larger programs.
Compiled programs are used to help solve more challenging problems, like interpreting source
code.
Compiled programming languages are often referred to more simply as programming languages.
A compiler program creates a program file, which runs the software.
Simply put: It piles the code into one file that runs when you double-click on the app on your 
device.
The program runs faster and it can be done repeatedly.
The source code is converted from the programming language to machine code.
Then it is compiled into one executable file.
Finally, the program runs when you select the icon or file on your device.
Some examples of compiled programming languages are:
C and its variations C++ and C#, which are used in many operating systems, like Microsoft 
Windows, Apple's macOS, and the open-source operating system Linux.
Java is another compiled programming language.
It shouldn't be confused with the interpreted language JavaScript.
The Android OS is written in Java because it works well across computing platforms.
Let's look at this process:
When you update to a new version of your operating system, like Microsoft Windows, your device
might download an installation program.
That program is made up of many files.
The files are written in a compiled programming language.
These files give instructions to your device in machine code.
The compiled program is running on your device.
A compiled program that you commonly use is your device's operating system, such as Linux, 
Microsoft Windows, Apple's macOS, or Android.
Your operating system is written in a compiled programming language, like C, C++, C#, or
Java.

In this video, you learned that:
Interpreted programming languages run scripts that are repetitive and need to be run often.
Interpreted programming languages are more versatile and can be used across platforms as long as 
there is the correct interpreter.
Some examples of interpreted programming languages are JavaScript, Python, and HTML.
Compiled programming languages are for more complex programs that complete larger tasks.
Compiled programming languages are used for creating executable files that can run directly from 
your device.
And some examples of compiled programming languages are C and Java.


Reading: Scripting Languages

A script is a package of code that automates a time-consuming, tedious task, or process. For 
example, you could use scripts to do any of the following:
•	Rename a large number of files
•	Update databases
•	Run complex, multi-step processes (like building and deploying software or backing up and 
restoring data)
•	Gather and process data from multiple sources (like system logs or APIs- which are rules 
that tell apps how to talk to each other)
•	Configure company-wide software installations
•	Set up multiple user accounts over time
Scripts are useful for tasks done regularly or on multiple systems or machines. Scripts can also 
automate tasks that require resources not easily accessed through a user interface or tasks that 
require resources from multiple systems or services. Scripts save time, reduce errors, and 
improve efficiency when used in this way. But it's important to make sure the script is tested 
and maintained.
Scripts that automate application installations include instructions to download and run the 
package, accept any prompts, and verify the installation was successful.
Scripts that automate system information gathering include instructions to retrieve hardware 
and software configuration data, system performance, system logs, and more.
A scripting language is a computer programming language used to write scripts. Python, 
Bash, PowerShell, and Batch are all scripting languages. Each has different capabilities, use 
cases, and syntax (or language rules).
•	Python has many applications and is a versatile and popular choice for many projects. 
People often use Python for web development, data analysis, and automation, and it is 
known for its easy-to-read syntax, powerful capabilities, and large developer 
community.
•	Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a scripting language commonly used on Unix and Linux 
operating systems. It is part of a program with the same name. The Bash program 
interprets and executes a command-line command and returns the output. Programs 
that do this are called "shells" or "command line interpreters." Programmers use the 
Bash scripting language or shell scripting, command-line management, and system 
administration. Bash scripts typically automate command line tasks like manipulating 
files and directories, running commands, and managing system processes.
•	PowerShell is a Microsoft command-line shell and scripting language developed for MS 
Windows systems. Programmers use it in automation, configuration management, and 
system administration. PowerShell scripts typically automate command-line tasks 
requiring access to the Windows OS or other Microsoft products and services.
•	Batch automates tasks and processes on MS Windows systems. Batch scripts are used 
with PowerShell or VBScript to perform complex tasks or to access additional 
functionality. Batch scripts typically automate command line tasks, like manipulating 
files and directories, running commands, and managing system processes. They can 
also automate tasks that require access to the MS Windows OS or other Microsoft 
products and services. MS Windows Command Prompt or MS Windows PowerShell 
executes batch scripts.
Python is more powerful and flexible than Bash or PowerShell. It has an extensive collection of 
prewritten code called a library. There are many additional Third-party libraries for Python and 
multiple code-building tools and platforms called frameworks. Bash, PowerShell, and Batch are 
better suited for command-line tasks, system administration, and automation.

Introduction to Programming Concepts

Welcome to Introduction to Programming Concepts.
After watching this video, you will be able to describe the purpose and use of identifiers in 
programming, describe the purpose and use of functions in programming, and describe the purpose 
and use of objects in programming.
To fully understand software programming, there are some fundamental programming concepts you 
need to know first.
The first concepts you will look at are identifiers.
Software developers use an identifier to reference a program component, such as a stored value, 
a method, an interface, or a class by assigning a custom-named label to it.
If the identifier stores data, then the data values in the program can be one of two types, either a 
constant or a variable.
A constant is a data item whose value does not change within a program.
This could be a numerical constant, such as the mathematical value of Pi, or it could be a text 
string that remains constant, such as a player's name within a game.
Constants are also referred to as named constants.
You assign a value to a constant when you define it.
For example, you might want it to refer to a numerical value within your program, such as Pi, or a 
cost price, or a rate of tax.
Then rather than repeatedly retyping the same numerical value, you can just declare a constant for 
the value instead and name it something meaningful, like Pi_value, or cost_price, or tax_rate.
There are a couple of major benefits to using constants in your programs.
One is for ease of readability in your code, and the other is that if the specified value changes in the 
future, you only need to change it once on the constant rather than finding every instance of that 
numerical value within your code and changing it.
The other type of identifier used in programming is a variable.
As the name suggests, this kind of identifier is not constant.
Its value can change during the program's execution, such as a user entering their age in an 
application or a high score in a game.
Variables can be strings of text, numerical values, or any other type of data.
Using a variable as an identifier is a useful way to refer to program items that are unknown to you,
such as a username, a service, or a filename, for instance.
If you don't use a variable, then you will need to hard code all the names and values in your 
program, which is not considered best practice.
Variables can be declared and assigned a datatype and initial value as they are defined, or you 
can decide not to assign an initial value when you define a variable and instead have the value 
assigned later by instructions within the program.
Next, let's look at the fundamental concept of functions.
Functions are a consequence of the modular programming software development 
methodology that encourages the separation of a program into multiple modular components, 
where each performs a specific task within a program.
So a function is essentially a piece of structured, standalone, and reusable code that will 
perform a single specific action.
a substantial complex program and divide it into smaller, more manageable, and focused pieces.
Although some programming languages may refer to them as something else, such as subroutines, 
procedures, methods, or modules, most modern programming languages refer to them as 
functions.
Functions take in data as an input, then process the data, and then return the result as an 
output.
There are essentially two types of functions, standard library functions are the built-in 
functions provided by the programming language.
Common examples include the if, else, while, and print functions.
But programming languages also allow you to write your own functions.
Once you've written a function, you can use it over and over again.
The way that the blocks of code that make up a function are identified is different across 
programming languages.
Some use braces, some use begin and end statements, and others use indentations, for 
example.
There are a few steps to using functions.
The first thing you need to do is define or create a function.
When you define a function, you provide a function keyword, then give the function a unique name, 
and you provide the statements that make up the body of the function.
Once a function has been defined, it then needs to be called or invoked.
When you call a function, the specified actions within the function are performed using any specific 
parameters.
While defining and calling functions are common to all programming languages, some 
programming languages such as C and C++ also require you to declare a function.
Next, let's look at the concept of objects.
Understanding what objects are is key to understanding object-oriented programming.
Object-oriented programming or OOP is a programming methodology that is focused on 
objects rather than functions, which is what procedure-oriented programming is focused on.
The objects themselves will contain data in the form of properties or attributes and code in 
the form of procedures or methods.
The key distinction between the two methodologies is that where procedural programming uses 
methods to operate on separate data structures, OOP packages them both together so an object 
operates on its own data structure.
Consider the real-world objects in your life, such as your car, bike, TV, or your washing machine, 
and ask yourself the following two questions.
What states can the object be in and what behaviours can the object to perform?
When you think about your answers to these questions, you will find that the answers to these 
questions vary across the objects.
More complex objects will typically have more potential states they can be in and will be able 
to perform more behaviours.
In programming, a software object is similar to a real-world object, conceptually speaking, in 
that they, too, consists of states or properties and behaviors or methods.
Software objects can be anything such as a Windows service, a user account, a database table, or 
a system folder.
Objects store their properties in fields referred to as variables in some programming 
languages and expose their behaviors through methods referred to as functions in some 
programming languages.

In this video, you learned that software developers use an identifier to reference a program 
component.
If an identifier stores data, then it can either be a constant or a variable.
A constant is a data item whose value does not change within the program.
A variable is not constant, it can change during the program's execution.
A function is a piece of structured, standalone, and reusable code that will perform a single specific 
action.
The defining and calling a function is common to all programming languages.
Object-oriented programming is a programming methodology that is focused on objects rather than 
functions. Software objects consist of properties and methods.
Branching and Looping Programming Logic

Welcome to Branching and Looping Programming Logic.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the two types of programming logic
Define Boolean expressions and variables
and list the differences between branching and looping.
There are two major types of programming logic: branching and looping. Both types use Boolean
expressions and variables:
A Boolean expression is a type of programming statement with only two values, either "true"
or "false."
And variables have assigned values that are passed into a function or subroutine within a 
more extensive program.
Computers use Boolean logic to make decisions. The computer takes one action if a Boolean
expression is true and a different action if the expression is false.
Typically, a program consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do and data that the 
program uses when it is running. A variable has a value that can change, depending on 
conditions or information passed to the program. Boolean logic, along with variables, form 
the basis of programming.
Branching logic is where a computer program makes a decision following a different set of 
instructions, depending on whether certain conditions are met during the program's 
execution.
Each possible code pathway creates another branch. The branch of code that runs depends on the 
values assigned to the parameters of the branching procedure. There is no limit to the number of 
branches to implement complex logic.
The values of these parameters may be input by the user or generated by the output from a 
previous procedure.
Branching contains constructs that occur and are processed to determine the path a program
takes when running.
Branching statements (also known as constructs) allow the execution flow to jump to a 
different
part of the program. The common branching statements used within other control structures
include:
if,
if-then-else,
Switch,
and GoTo.
The if statement is a decision-making construct that guides a program to make decisions based
on specified criteria. The if statement executes one code set when a specific condition is met 
(TRUE) or another code set if the condition is not met (FALSE).
The if-then-else is a conditional construct that executes its sub-statement, which follows the "then" 
keyword. This only occurs if the provided condition is true.
The if-else statement extends the "if" statement by specifying an action if the "if" (true/false 
expression) is false. With the if-else statement, the program will execute either the true code block 
or the false code block, so something is always performed with an if-else statement.
In computer programming languages, a switch statement is a type of selection control mechanism 
used to allow the value of a variable or expression to change the control flow of 
program execution via search and map.
GoTo is a statement found in many computer programming languages that performs a one-way
transfer of control to another line of code. In contrast, a function call typically returns
control.
Now, let's look at the logic of looping programming. A loop is a sequence of instructions that 
continually repeats until reaching a specific condition. Typically, a particular process is 
performed, such as retrieving and changing data, and then some conditions are checked, such as 
whether a counter has reached a prescribed number. If it has not, the next instruction in the 
sequence is to return to the first instruction in the series and repeat the sequence. If the 
condition is reached, the next instruction "falls through" to the next sequential instruction or 
branches outside the loop. A loop is a fundamental programming idea commonly used in writing 
programs.
There are three basic loop statements:
While
For
And Do-while.
In a While loop, a condition is evaluated before processing the body of the loop. If a condition is 
true then and only then the body of a loop is executed.
In a For loop, the initial value is performed only once, then the condition tests and compares 
the counter to a fixed value after each iteration, stopping the For loop when false is returned.
In a Do-while loop, the condition is always executed after the body of a loop. It is also called an 
exit-controlled loop.

In this video, you learned that:
There are two major types of programming logic: branching and looping. Both types of logic use 
Boolean expressions and variables.
Boolean expressions have only two possible values, either true or false, and variables have assigned 
values that are passed into a function or subroutine within a more extensive
program. Variables have values that can change, depending on conditions or information passed
to the program.
And branching is deciding what actions to take, while looping is deciding how many times
to perform a certain action.

Lesson Summary: Basics of Programming 
Languages
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	Interpreted languages run repetitive scripts that need to be run often. They are more versatile 
because they can be used across platforms. The source code goes through an interpreter built 
into the operating system on a computer or web browser.
•	Compiled programming languages are used for creating executable files that can run directly 
from your device.
•	Common programming concepts include variables, constants, arrays, vectors, functions, and 
objects.
•	The two types of programming logic are branching and looping.


Types of Data, Sources, and Uses

Welcome to Types of Data, Sources, and Uses.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify different types of data,
Recognize data sources, and List some of the ways to use data.
Today's world is full of data. But how do we define data?
Data is any set of characters that is gathered and translated for some purpose, usually 
research or analysis.
Data can consist of:
Facts, observations, perceptions;
Numbers, characters, symbols;
Images, audio, text;
or any combination of these.
There are multiple types of data, including these common types:
Single character,
Boolean (true or false),
Text (string),
Number (integer or floating point),
Picture,
Sound,
and Video.
Data can be classified as primary or secondary.
Primary data is generated directly by the individual needing the information.
Secondary data is information is data that has already been gathered for another purpose.
Raw data, also known as primary data, contains numbers, instrument readings, and figures 
collected from sources. In the context of an examination, the raw data might be a raw score.
When processed, this raw data output can be analysed and studied.
Data and information are collected on a computer using a hard drive or another storage 
device.
Data is stored in binary form using 0s and 1s.
There are several forms of data.
Personal data is anything specific to an individual, like name, demographics, location, 
address, and other identifying information.
Transactional data is anything that requires an action to collect the information. Clicking 
online advertisements, making an online purchase, and visiting certain websites are all forms of 
transactional data.
Transactional data is crucial for businesses, helping them to expose variability and optimize
operations.
Web data refers to any data pulled from the Internet for research or other purposes. Web
data is a catch-all for public-facing information on the Internet (in other words, not stored in a 
private database). Companies can use this information to monitor competitors, track potential 
customers, keep track of channel partners, generate leads, and build applications.
Sensor data is information produced by objects and is often known as the Internet of Things.
This type of data covers everything from a smartwatch measuring heart rates and temperature, to a 
building with external sensors that measure the weather or turn on lights when motion is detected. 
Currently, sensor data's primary use is to help optimize processes.
The level and rigidity of the data's structure determine the information's classification.
Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.
Databases store and display structured data in rows and columns, similar to an Excel or Word 
table. The information has a well-defined schema and a rigid structure. These characteristics
make relational databases, which store data in tables, ideal for structured data. Microsoft SQL 
Server, IBM Db2, and Oracle databases are forms of structured data.
Semi-structured data has some organizational properties; however, the information does not 
collect in the rows and columns required by a rigid, tabular schema. Instead, semi-structured
data is organized into a hierarchy using tags and metadata and is stored in non-relational
databases.
Unstructured data is information that does not have an identifiable structure or specific 
format, sequence, semantics, or rules, and is often stored in NoSQL databases. The most
common examples of unstructured data include text, like Word documents and emails. 
However,
unstructured data also includes images, audio files, and log files.
MongoDB, Hbase, Cassandra DB, and Oracle NoSQL DB are forms of semi-structured and 
unstructured data.
A multitude of data sources are available today, including:
Internal organizational data stored in a database;
Publicly available data like weather, financial, and government;
APIs and web services,;
Web sites;
Data streams and feeds;
Social platforms;
and Devices with sensors.
This data is stored, processed, and made available for analysis, providing businesses with insights
into their performance.
Data sources can be: internal or external.
When an individual collects data from reports and records supplied by an organization, group, or 
other entity, this is known as internal sourcing. Examples of internal sources include accounting 
information, order processing details, payroll, and shipping information.
When users collect data from sources outside an organization, group, or other entity, this is 
known as an external sourcing. Examples of external sources include social media feeds, weather 
reports, government information, and research.
Companies use internal and external data to scale up businesses, understand customer 
purchasing trends, and increase overall productivity.

In this video, you learned that:
Data is information like facts, observations, perceptions, numbers, characters, and images
that are processed to become meaningful, for example, upper- and lower-case letters, numerals, and 
special characters.
Data can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, depending on the level and rigidity
of its organization.
Different data sources offer different types of data; for example, data from social media
can be unstructured or semi-structured.
And data is essential to many organizations and is used to manage information from accounting
to shipping and routing. Data is generated constantly in today's world, 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.


Overview of Data Repositories
A data repository is a general term used to refer to data that has been collected, organized,
and isolated so that it can be used for business operations or mined for reporting and data analysis.
It can be a small or large database infrastructure with one or more databases that collect, manage,
and store data sets.
In this video, we will provide an overview of the different types of repositories your data might 
reside in, such as databases, data warehouses, and big data stores, and examine them in greater 
detail in further videos.
Let's begin with databases.
A database is a collection of data, or information, designed for the input, storage, search and 
retrieval, and modification of data.
And a Database Management System, or DBMS, is a set of programs that creates and 
maintains
the database.
It allows you to store, modify, and extract information from the database using a function 
called querying.
For example, if you want to find customers who have been inactive for six months or more, using 
the query function, the database management system will retrieve data of all customers from the 
database that have been inactive for six months and more.
Even though a database and DBMS mean different things the terms are often used interchangeably.
There are different types of databases.
Several factors influence the choice of database, such as the data type and structure, querying 
mechanisms, latency requirements, transaction speeds, and intended use of the data.
It's important to mention two main types of databases here-relational and non-relational 
databases.
Relational databases, also referred to as RDBMSes, build on the organizational principles of 
flat files, with data organized into a tabular format with rows and columns following a well-
defined structure and schema.
However, unlike flat files, RDBMSes are optimized for data operations and querying involving
many tables and much larger data volumes.
Structured Query Language, or SQL, is the standard querying language for relational 
databases.
Then we have non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL, or "Not Only SQL".
Non-relational databases emerged in response to the volume, diversity, and speed at which data is 
being generated today, mainly influenced by advances in cloud computing, the Internet
of Things, and social media proliferation.
Built for speed, flexibility, and scale, non-relational databases made it possible to store data in a 
schema-less or free-form fashion.
NoSQL is widely used for processing big data.
A data warehouse works as a central repository that merges information coming from 
disparate sources and consolidates it through the extract, transform, and load process, also 
known as the ETL process, into one comprehensive database for analytics and business 
intelligence.
At a very high-level, the ETL process helps you to extract data from different data sources, 
transform the data into a clean and usable state, and load the data into the enterprise's data 
repository.
Related to Data Warehouses are the concepts of Data Marts and Data Lakes, which we will cover 
later.
Data Marts and Data Warehouses have historically been relational, since much of the 
traditional
enterprise data has resided in RDBMSes.
However, with the emergence of NoSQL technologies and new sources of data, non-relational 
data
repositories are also now being used for Data Warehousing.
Another category of data repositories are Big Data Stores, that include distributed 
computational and storage infrastructure to store, scale, and process very large data sets.
Overall, data repositories help to isolate data and make reporting and analytics more
efficient and credible while also serving as a data archive.

Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases

Welcome to Introduction to SQL and relational databases.
After watching this video, you'll be able to describe what SQL, data, and a database is,
define relational database, DBMS, and RDBMS, and list the five basic SQL commands.
SQL is a language used for relational databases to query or get data out of a database.
SQL is also referred to as SQL and it's short for its original name, Structured English Query 
Language. SQL is a language used for a database to query data.
But what is data and what is a database?
Data is a collection of facts in the form of words, numbers, or even pictures.
Data is one of the most critical assets of any business.
It is used in collected practically everywhere.
Your bank stores data about you, your name, address, phone number, account number, etc.
Your credit card company and your PayPal accounts also store data about you.
Data is important, so it needs to be secure and it needs to be stored and accessed quickly.
The answer is a database.
So what is a database?
Databases are everywhere and used every day, but they are largely taken for granted.
A database is a repository of data.
It's a program that stores data.
A database also provides the functionality for adding, modifying, and querying that data.
There are different kinds of databases of different requirements.
The data can be stored in various forms.
When data is stored in tabular form, the data is organized in tables,
like in a spreadsheet, which has columns and rows.
That's a relational database.
The columns contain properties about the items such as last name,
first name, email address, city.
A table is a collection of related things, like a list of employees or list of book authors.
In a relational database, you can form relationships between tables.
A database is a repository of data.
A set of software tools for the data in the database is called a database management system or 
DBMS for short.
The terms database, database server, database system, data server, and database management 
systems are often used interchangeably.
For relational databases, it's called a relational database management system or RDBMS.
RDBMS is a set of software tools that controls the data such as access, organization, and 
storage,
and RDBMS serves as the backbone of applications in many industries, including banking, 
transportation, health, and so on.
Examples of relational database management systems are MySQL, Oracle database, DB2 
Warehouse and DB2 on Cloud.
For the majority of people using a database, there are five simple commands to create a table,
insert data to populate the table, select data from the table, update data in the table, delete 
data from the table.
Those are the building blocks for SQL for data science.
You can now describe what is SQL, what is data, what is a database,
and what is a relational database.
You know that RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
You can list five basic SQL commands to create a table, insert data to populate the table, 
select data from the table, update data in the table, and delete data from the table.
Thanks for watching this video.

Database Management

Welcome to Database Management.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe how databases are managed.
Identify the three major SQL command categories and what each one does.
And explain how to input and extract database information.
Databases are managed with Structured Query Language (or SQL) commands and queries. A
database query refers to the retrieval and management of data or information from a database.
A database query generates data of different formats according to function.
Query commands perform the retrieval and management of data in a relational database.
With SQL commands, you can:
Provide access to data in relational database management systems.
Describe the data
Manipulate that data.
Create and drop databases and tables.
View stored functions and procedures in a database.
And set permissions on tables, procedures, and views.
SQL commands can be grouped into the following categories based on functionality:
Data Definition Language (or DDL),
Data Manipulation Language (or DML),
And Data Control Language (or DCL).
DDL consists of the SQL commands used to define the database schema.
DDL commands enable you to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data.
Common DDL commands include the following:
The CREATE command that creates the database or its objects (such as tables, indexes, functions,
views, store procedures, and triggers).
The DROP command that deletes objects from the database.
The ALTER command that alters the structure of the database.
And the TRUNCATE command that removes all records from a table, including all spaces allocated 
for the records.
This is an example of the DROP command where "Table" is the name of the table to be deleted.
DML includes most of the SQL commands that deal with the manipulation of data in the
database.
The DML command is the component of the SQL statement that controls access to data and
to the database.
Common DML commands include the following:
The INSERT command that inserts data into a database table.
The UPDATE command that updates existing data within a database table.
The DELETE command that removes records from a database table.
And the SELECT command that retrieves records from a database table according to clauses
(for example, FROM and WHERE) that specify criteria.
This is an example of the DELETE command.
DCL includes commands which mainly deal with the rights, permissions, and other controls
of the database system. DCL commands create and modify the structure of objects in the
database.
DCL commands include the following:
The GRANT command that provides users with access permissions to the database.
And the REVOKE command that withdraws users' access permissions given by the GRANT 
command.
Here is an example of the REVOKE command.
One way of inserting data into a database is through queries. Some of these query commands
include:
CREATE database, CREATE table, and INSERT INTO table.
Here is an example of inputting data into a relational database using these commands.
The other way to input data is by importing it from external sources into a database using
software tools and utilities.
This example shows importing an Excel data source into a SQL server database.
Importing multiple worksheets from an Excel workbook into a SQL server database typically
involves using one of the following software application tools:
SQL Server Import and Export Wizard, SQL Server Integrated Services (or SSIS), or the 
OPENROWSET function.
Importing data directly from Excel files using the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard involves
following a sequence of dialog boxes through a series of well-defined steps. The settings
can be saved as an SSIS package that can be customized and reused later.
The OPENROWSET function imports data directly into SQL server from Excel files by using
the Transact-SQL OPENROWSET or OPENDATASOURCE function. This process is called a 
distributed query.
There are two ways to extract data from a database: queries and report builders.
A query is a question defined and sent to the data source to retrieve the data.
Here is an example of the SELECT command to retrieve data from a table.
Reports offer a way to view, format, and summarize the information in a database. A database
report is the formatted result of database queries that contains useful data for decision-making
and analysis.
Reports can be a simple list of phone numbers of all contacts or more complex like a summary
report on the total sales across different regions and time periods.
There are many data reporting tools that are popular on the market today including:
ClearPoint, SAP Crystal Reports, and Jaspersoft reporting.

In this video, you learned that:
SQL commands are the instructions used to communicate with a database to perform tasks, 
functions, and queries with data. SQL commands can be used to search the database and perform
other functions like creating tables, adding data to tables, modifying data, and dropping tables.
SQL commands are grouped into three major categories depending on their functionality:
DDL commands that are used for creating, modifying, and dropping the structure of database 
objects;
DML commands that are used for storing, retrieving, modifying, and deleting data; and DCL 
commands that are used for providing security to database objects.
And data is input into a database using the queries CREATE database, CREATE table, and INSERT
INTO table, and data is extracted by using queries and reporting software tools such as ClearPoint, 
SAP Crystal Reports, and Jaspersoft reporting.

Reading: Database Roles and Permissions and 
Backing Up Databases
Database permissions allow a user to access a specific database or database table. There are three 
main types of database permissions in decreasing scope:
•	Database permissions and privileges execute a specific type of SQL statement or access 
a second person's object. Database privilege controls the use of computing resources and 
does not apply to the database administrator (DBA).
•	System permission is the right to perform an activity, such as creating, altering, or 
dropping, on a specific object type. The ability to add or delete columns and rows of any 
table in a database is an example of system permission.
•	Object privilege is the right to perform a specific action on a table, function, or 
package. For example, the right to delete rows from a table is an object privilege. This 
privilege allows the user to INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, or SELECT the data in the 
database object. An object's owner has all object permissions for that object, and those 
permissions cannot be revoked. The object's owner can grant object permissions for that 
object to other database users. A user with ADMIN privilege can grant and revoke object 
permissions from users who do not own the objects on which the permissions are granted.
Permission Commands
Permission commands enforce database security in a multiple-user database environment. There are 
three main permission commands.
•	The GRANT command provides user access rights or permissions to the database objects. 
This command also allows users to grant access rights to other users.
•	The REVOKE command removes user access rights or permissions to the database 
objects.
•	The DENY command denies permission on an object and prevents the principal from 
gaining GRANT permission based on membership in a group or role.
Only a database administrator (DBA) or the owner of a database object can provide/remove 
permissions on a database object.
Database Roles
A database role is a collection of permissions assigned to one or more users. Roles allow you to 
grant and manage sets of permissions for various categories of users rather than grant those 
permissions to each user individually. The DBAs maintain user roles and apply them to the entire 
server, not an individual database file. The public role sets the basic default permissions for all 
users. Every user added to a SQL Server is automatically assigned to the public role, so no 
additional actions are needed. Database roles are applied to an individual database. Two common 
roles to know are:
•	The db_owner role gives members full access to the database.
•	The db_datareader role allows members to read all data in the database.
Benefits of Roles
Users can grant database roles to set system or schema object permissions and other roles. 
However, a role cannot be granted to itself or granted circularly. For example, role A cannot be 
granted to role B if role B has previously been granted to role A, to any database user, or to a user 
that has been enabled or disabled.
Database Backup
Backing up a database protects data, whether a person's or an organization's, from disaster and 
allows for restoring information when necessary. A backup, usually performed by a relational 
database management system or database manager, replicates a database or server that can 
be saved locally or on a backup server.
Database backups are categorized as either physical or logical. A logical backup is called a 
database dump, and a physical backup is completed through backup software. Some examples 
of backup software include:
•	ScaleGrid
•	Cyber Shield
•	Backup Ninja
•	SQL Safe Backup
Physical database backups are copies of directories and data files, including data controls, 
transaction files, and archived logs. This information is necessary for a full database restoration 
with minimal application errors and data loss. The backups, which can be full or incremental 
copies of the physical backup, should always be stored in a separate, dedicated storage space 
such as a disk, tape, or the cloud. Physical backups are simple and fast, regardless of the data 
format. The physical backup is a mirror copy that is loaded onto another device. The downside 
to physical backups is that this type is typically used only to recreate the system at restoration 
and cannot do a full restoration if there are any missing files.
A logical database backup contains copies of information about a database (such as tables, 
schemas, and procedures). This data is commonly exported as binary files using EXPORT/IMPORT 
tools. Logical backups are helpful when restoring or moving a copy of the database to another 
environment. With logical backups, only a selected set of data is backed up, saving time and 
storage. The downside is that there is no file system information, which complicates the 
restoring process.
Database Backup Methods
There are four database backup methods available.
•	A full backup stores a copy of all files following an automatic preset schedule. Typically, 
files are compressed to save space, but a lot of storage space may still be needed.
•	A differential backup simplifies recovery, requiring only the last full backup and the last 
differential backup to create a complete database recovery.
•	An incremental backup saves storage by backing up the files generated or updated since 
the last backup.
•	A virtual backup uses a database to track and maintain backup data, helping to avoid the 
pitfalls of other methods.
Online backup services such as cloud storage offer additional protection for emergencies such 
as natural disasters. Automatic backup and detailed file management enhance processing and 
recovery without needing manual effort.
Backup Management
After making a solid plan and completing initial work, the database administrator should properly 
manage backups by:
•	Automating backups
•	Monitoring backups
•	Keeping backup logs and catalogs
•	Maintaining the database catalog
•	Setting up dependencies
•	Validating backups
There are a multitude of ways to store data:
•	Online
•	USB drives
•	External hard drives
•	Local area networks

Lesson Summary: Database Fundamentals
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	Different types of data include single character, Boolean, text, integer, or floating-point 
decimal, picture, sound, and video.

Computer Networks: Types and Topologies

Welcome to "Network Types and Topologies."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define what a computer network is and its purpose
Identify the most popular network types
And list the characteristics of the five main network topologies
Computer networking refers to connected computing devices like laptops, servers, and smartphones.
and an ever-expanding array of IoT devices like security cameras, door locks,
doorbells, refrigerators, thermostats, and more.
Computer networks enable data transfer and resource sharing through emails,
files, documents, databases, and notifications amongst multiple users.
There are multiple network types:
PAN, or Personal Area Network
LAN, or Local Area Network
MAN, or Metropolitan Area Network
WAN, or Wide Area Network
WLAN, or Wireless LAN
And VPN, or Virtual Private Network
A PAN, or Personal Area Network, enables communication between devices around a person. PANs 
can be wired or wireless, such as USB, firewire, infrared, ZigBee, and Bluetooth. They range from a 
few centimetres to a few meters.
PANs are also used to connect laptops, tablets, printers, keyboards, and other computerized devices.
One of the most common real-world examples of a PAN is the connection between a Bluetooth 
earpiece and a smartphone.
A LAN, or Local Area Network, is typically limited to a small, localized area, such as a single 
building or site.
A LAN is a group of computers and peripheral devices that share a connection to a server.
A LAN may serve two or three users in a home office, or several hundred users in a corporation's 
central office.
LANs enable network devices to share resources like printers or network storage.
LANs require cables, switches, and routers so users can connect to internal servers, websites, and 
other LANs.
A MAN, or Metropolitan Area Network, is a network that spans an entire city, a campus, or a small 
region.
MANs are sometimes referred to as CANs (Campus Area Networks).
A MAN is optimized for a larger geographical area than a LAN, ranging from several building 
blocks to entire cities.
A MAN is often formed by connecting multiple LANs. Examples of MANs include:
cable TV networks, telephone networks providing high-speed DSL lines, or any public or free Wifi 
system provided to residents of a city.
A WAN, or Wide Area Network, is a network that extends over a large geographic area.
WANs are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.
WANs are often used by Businesses, Schools, and government entities to relay data from almost 
anywhere in the world, allowing them to carry out daily functions regardless of location.
The Internet is an example of a WAN.
A WLAN, or Wireless LAN, links two or more devices using wireless communication to form a 
LAN within a limited area, such as
a home
school
computer lab
campus
or office building.
Users can move around within the area and remain connected to the network.
Through a gateway device, a WLAN can also provide a connection to the wider Internet.
WLANs are used in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and gaming consoles.
Topology defines a network's structure-its physical layout and virtual shape.
A network's topology type is chosen based on the specific needs of the group installing that 
network.
Each topology type has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
Physical Topology describes how network devices are physically connected.
Logical Topology describes how data flows across the physically connected network devices.
The five main types of physical network topology include:
Star,
Ring,
Bus,
Tree, and
Mesh.
Star topology networks feature a central computer that acts as a hub.
Each device connects to the central computer with a dedicated cable known as a backbone cable.
Star topologies are the most common type used in many networks, large and small.
Ring topology networks connect all devices in a circular ring pattern where data only flows in one 
direction (clockwise).
Each device receives and passes on the data until it reaches the intended recipient device, which 
processes the data.
A small office with only a few nodes may use a ring network topology.
Bus topology networks connect all devices with a single cable or transmission line.
This cable functions as a shared communication channel that devices can tap into without a separate 
network connection device.
Bus topology is the simplest kind of topology used. It is mainly suited for small networks such as 
LAN.
Tree topology networks combine the characteristics of bus topology and star topology.
Tree topology is a type of structure in which all the computers are connected with each other in a 
hierarchical fashion.
An example of a tree topology use case is a university campus in which each building has its own 
star network, and all the central computers are linked in a campus-wide system.
Mesh topology networks connect all devices on the network together.
Each mesh network device has special mesh network software installed so that it can automatically 
choose the quickest path to the intended recipient.
This is called dynamic routing.
Mesh topology is commonly used in WAN for backup purposes.
This topology is not used in LAN implementations.
The Internet is an example of mesh topology.
Virtual networks are software-based. They control and direct communication across existing 
physical networks.
Any physical network location can be assigned to a virtual network by a network administrator.
Virtual networks make network administration easier, increase network efficiency, and improve 
security.
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, establishes a private or protected network connection across 
public networks.
VPNs encrypt your internet traffic, disguise your online identity, and safeguard your data by 
preventing unauthorized people from eavesdropping.
The encryption takes place in real time and ensures that sensitive data is securely transmitted.
A VLAN, or Virtual Local Area Network, is a network made up of locations from other networks.
VLANs are software-based.
they separate larger networks into smaller groups, and they do not require users to be in the same 
physical space.
VLANs are useful when you want to share data securely.
Employees from different groups in a large company can each be assigned to a specific VLAN, 
which will allow them to securely collaborate and share data with each other.

In this video, you learned that:
A computer network enables two or more computers to be connected so users can communicate and 
share resources.
Network types range in size from a few meters to world-wide.
They include PAN, LAN, MAN, WAN, and WLAN
Network topology defines the structure of a network and its physical and logical types.
Network topology types include Star, Ring, Tree, Bus, and Mesh.
Virtual networks like VPN and VLAN add efficiency and security.


Reading: Computer Networks: Cables


A computer cable provides a physical connection to transmit data or signals between various 
components, peripherals, or devices. Cables come in several shapes, sizes, and connectors, each 
serving a specific purpose.
Hard Drive Cables
Hard drive cables connect a hard drive to a motherboard or controller card or may also connect 
optical drives and older floppy drives.
•	SATA carries high-speed data and connects to storage devices, hard disks, and optical and 
solid-state drives.
 

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	Integrated drive electronics or IDE is an older interface. The IDE cable is a 40-wire 
ribbon cable connecting the motherboard on one end to one or two drives on the other.
 
•	Small Computer System Interface, or SCSI, was designed to support various device 
types. This means there are different types of SCSI cables. They may be ribbon or standard 
round cables of 50, 68, or 80 wires. Up to 16 devices, including the motherboard or SCSI 
controller card, may be connected to one SCSI cable or daisy chained together.
 
Multipurpose Cables
Multipurpose cables connect devices and peripherals directly together without a network 
connection. They can transfer both data and power.
•	USB cables connect to a wide variety of peripheral devices. USB supports multiple speeds 
depending upon the version.
•	USB-C cables are now common and include USB 2.0, USB 3.0, USB 3.1, and USB 4. 
Speeds range from 480 megabits per second up to 40 gigabits per second. Note that the 
actual speed may be lower depending on the device it is being used with.
 
•	Lightning cables are proprietary to Apple. They are used to connect Apple devices to USB 
ports. It can carry both data and power to charge the device.
 
•	Thunderbolt is another Apple proprietary cable. It comes as either copper or optical cable. 
The maximum length is 3 meters for copper and 60 meters for optical. It provides data and 
power to peripheral devices, most commonly storage and display devices.
 
Video Cables
Video cables connect a specific type of video port on a computer to a display. Each has its own 
connector type.
•	VGA cables connect older analog video graphics adapters to a display.
 
•	HDMI cables connect a high-definition multimedia interface to a display. There are 
different types of HDMI cables. Type-A is the most common but is usually referred to as 
HDMI cable with no designation. Mini-HDMI is a HDMI Type-C cable.

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	DisplayPort cables connect a DisplayPort interface to a display.

•	DVI cables connect a digital visual interface to a display.







Serial Cables
A serial cable transfers information between two devices using the RS-232 standard, which states 
that data bits must flow in a line one after another over the cable. Serial cables are used in modems, 
keyboards, mice, and other peripheral devices.





Adapters
Adapters are a temporary way to connect different types of cables.


 


•	
•	

•	DVI to VGA adapters connect analog and digital devices.
•	DVI to HDMI adapters connect older digital devices with newer ones.
•	USB-C to USB-A adapters connect to newer USB speeds and connect with older peripheral 
devices.
•	USB to Ethernet adapters provide Ethernet connectivity through USB ports. 
There are thousands of adapter types, but they all maintain signal and connector 
compatibility.
Network Cables
In wired networks, network cables connect devices and route information from one network device 
to another. A network's topology, protocol, and size determine the needed cable type. Some 
networks use only one cable type, while others use various cable types. There are three common 
types of network cables.
•	The coaxial or coax cable was initially developed to connect TVs to home antennas. These 
days it is used to send cable TV signals to cable boxes and the Internet to home modems. 
Coaxial cables contain an inner copper wire surrounded by insulation and other shielding. 
They are highly resistant to signal interference and can support greater cable lengths 
between network devices than twisted pair Ethernet cables. The coax cable has a 10-
megabit-per-second capacity.







•	Fiber optic cables are used in wide-area networks or WANs because they work over 
long distances without much interference and can handle a heavy volume of data traffic. 
Different types of fiber optic cables are used depending on the cost and the amount of 
bandwidth the cable can support.

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	Ethernet or twisted pair cables use the T568A and T568B networking standards to improve 
signal communication. They consist of four pairs of twisted wires to reduce interference. 
These cables hardwire a computer to a LAN. Hardwiring is faster and more consistent than 
Wi-Fi. Ethernet cables also have category numbers. A higher category number means the 
cable is newer and usually faster with better bandwidth. Category, distance, and bandwidth 
are considered when building networks using Ethernet. There are many types and categories 
of Ethernet cables.









Advantages and Disadvantages of Network Types


Welcome to "Advantages and Disadvantages of Network Types."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define the pros and cons of networking.
Explain how size and connection type affect a network.
And describe the pros and cons of each network type.
Computer networking refers to connected computing devices (like laptops, servers, and 
smartphones).
Networking has expanded to include Internet of Things devices (like security cameras, door locks, 
doorbells, refrigerators, thermostats, and more).
Networks:
Provide communication tools like email and chat, and enable the sharing of files and devices (like 
printers, security cameras, and sensors).
Networks provide centralized resources like storage databases, which enable bulk software 
installation, easy backups, and larger storage capacity.
Networks allow remote access when you're away from your computer but need to perform a task or 
get to specific files.
Networks also reduce hardware and software costs, And enable control over security and access.
However, networks also:
Require technical expertise And more maintenance than just one device.
Networks are more vulnerable to viruses and hacking, more expensive than using a single device,
And require other users and systems to function.
Smaller networks are easier to troubleshoot than larger networks.
They require less hardware and are Easier to secure, upgrade, and manage.
Smaller networks are not as flexible as larger networks when it comes to access, resources, and 
mobility, But they are less expensive.
Wired networks have fixed access points, while wireless networks can be accessed from anywhere 
in the network.
Wired networks have less expensive hardware than wireless but require more devices and cabling.
Wired networks are also easier to manage and offer faster connectivity and more security.
However, wired networks are less flexible than wireless when it comes to mobility and are also 
harder to set up and scale.
The basic network types can be wired or wireless. From smallest to largest, they are:
PAN or WPAN
LAN or WLAN
MAN or WMAN, and
WAN or WWAN
A personal area network, or PAN, enables communication between devices around a person.
PANs are wired and WPANs are wireless. PANs use technologies like USB and firewire.
WPANs use technologies like infrared, ZigBee, and Bluetooth.
PANs and WPANs range from a few centimetres to a few meters. PANs and WPANs are:
Flexible and mobile, have a one-time, easy setup, and are portable.
But they also have:
Limited range and limited bandwidth.
A local area network (or LAN) is a group of computers and peripheral devices that share a 
connection to a server. LANs use wired connections and WLANs use wireless connections.
A LAN or WLAN may serve two or three users in a home office or several hundred users in a 
corporation's central office.
LANs and WLANs enable network devices to share resources like printers or network storage.
LANs provide connection via cables, switches, and routers.
WLANs provide connection via wifi signals from wifi routers, modems, and wireless access points.
Advantages include:
Reliability and versatility.
High data transmission rates.
And they are easier to manage.
Disadvantages include:
Smaller network coverage area.
The number of devices affects speed.
And there are security risks.
A metropolitan area network (or MAN) is optimized for a larger geographical area than a LAN,
ranging from several building blocks to entire cities.
A MAN is often formed by connecting multiple LANs. Examples of MANs and WMANs include:
cable TV networks, telephone networks providing high-speed DSL lines, or any public or free wifi 
system provided to residents of a city.
A MAN or WMAN:
Covers multiple city locations.
Is easy to use, extend, and exchange.
And is managed by an ISP, government entity, or corporation.
However, it:
Requires special user permissions.
And has the higher costs and security risks that come with larger networks.
Wide area networks (or WANs) provide global coverage. WAN and WWAN examples
include the Internet and cellular networks.
WANs and WWANs offer:
Global coverage and more security.
However, they are:
Expensive
and difficult to maintain.

In this video, you learned that:
Networks offer control, remote access, and sharing but are harder to manage, vulnerable, and 
depend on other systems.
Smaller networks cost less and are easier to learn and manage, but have less power, capacity, and 
flexibility.
Wired networks are faster, more secure, and easier to manage, but require more hardware and offer 
less flexibility.
And each network type has its own pros and cons.

Reading: Computer Networks: Models, 
Standards, Protocols and Ports

A networking model describes the architecture, components, and design used to establish 
communication between the source and destination systems. Data packets follow the protocols of 
network models. In this reading, you will learn about two types of networking models.
The OSI, or Open Systems Interconnection Model, is a conceptual framework used to describe the 
functions of a networking system. Data flows across these layers when communicating over a 
network. The 7 layers of the OSI model include:
  
•	Application: Users and applications interact directly with the software application.
•	Presentation: Ensures data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs.
•	Session: Controls the flow of information between different computers, including 
authentication and reconnections.
•	Transport: Manages the delivery and error checking of data packets. Data is commonly 
transported using transmission control protocol or TCP.
•	Network: Responsible for interpreting the addresses and directing the path the data will take.
•	Data Link: Defines the format of data on the network. This layer also corrects errors that 
may have happened at the physical layer.
•	Physical: Electrically or optically transmits raw unstructured data over a physical medium.
The TCP/IP, or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model, is a set of standards that 
allow computers to communicate on a network. TCP/IP is based on the OSI model and functions 
similarly. The background protocols are still in place, but how they are organized is slightly 
different. The data travels through fewer layers on both ends. The 5 layers of the TCP/IP model 
include:
  
Network Standards
Network standards define the rules for data communications that are needed for the interoperability 
of networking technologies and processes. Standards are widely accepted protocols that engineers 
use to ensure that things they build integrate with existing devices & technology. There are two 
types of network standards:
•	De jure or Formal Standard are formal standards developed by an official industry or 
government body. Formal standards have gone through formal processes to obtain 
consensus, including publicly available documentation. Examples include HTTP, HTML, IP, 
and Ethernet 802.3d.
•	De facto standards result from marketplace domination or practice. De-Facto standards are 
accepted in practice but have not undergone any formal process to obtain consensus and may 
not have publicly available documentation. Typically, de facto standards result from 
marketplace domination or practice. Examples include Microsoft Windows and QWERTY 
keyboard.
Standards are usually created by government or non-profit organizations for the betterment of an 
entire industry. This ensures broader compatibility across vendors and industries. Some of the well-
known organizations that have created network standards are:
•	International Standards Organization, or ISO, established the well-known OSI reference 
networking model.
•	International Telecommunication Union, or ITU, standardized international telecom and set 
standards for fair use in radio frequency.
•	Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, established the TCP/IP protocol 
suite.
•	Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers, or IEEE, established the IEEE 802 
standards.
•	The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, established the world wide web (www) 
standard.
•	The Internet Engineering Task Force, or IETF, maintains the TCP/IP protocol suites. IETF 
also developed the Request for Comment, or RFC, standard.
Protocols
A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between 
different devices in the same network. Network protocols are typically created according to industry 
standards. There are thousands of different network protocols, but they all perform one of three 
primary actions: Security, Communication, and Network Management.
Transmission control protocol, or TCP, and user datagram protocol, or UDP, are two primary 
internet protocols. TCP guarantees that sent data makes it to its intended recipient. It's slower and 
requires more resources. File transfer protocol, FTP, web browsing, and email are typical 
applications of TCP.
UDP doesn't guarantee that all packets will arrive, but it's fast and requires fewer resources. It's 
good for live streaming, online gaming, and calls over the Internet.
The TCP/IP suite is a collection of protocols. Together these protocols provide a complete 
networking solution. The Internet of Things, or IoT, network model comprises diverse 
communication protocols, including data collection, data package, data transfer, and data control.
Ports
Ports are the first and last stop for information sent across a network. A port is a communication 
endpoint which always has an associated protocol and application. The protocol is the path that 
leads to the application's port. A network device can have up to 65,536 ports. Port numbers do not 
change.
Socket
A socket is a two-way communication channel. Each socket is made up of a source IP address, 
protocol, port number, or destination IP address. You use a socket whenever you send data over 
your local network or over the Internet. For example, whenever you use a web browser, send an 
email, or watch a video online, a socket is used over the network to make that communication 
possible.

Networking Hardware Devices

Welcome to "Networking Hardware Devices."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify common networking hardware devices.
List differences between similar network devices.
Explain the significance of each type of network device and its functions.
Network devices, or networking hardware, are physical devices that enable communication
and interaction on a computer network.
This includes cables, servers, desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and internet of things,
or IoT, devices.
This video covers network devices that connect or route, such as hubs, switches, routers,
bridges, and gateways.
A server is a powerful computer that stores files and applications.
Other computers or devices on the same network can access the server as a central place to
store information or use applications.
The devices that access the server are known as clients.
The server controls the level of access that clients have.
A user can access a server file or application from anywhere if they use a client that is
connected to the server's network and has the proper level of access (usually password-based).
A node is a network-connected device that can send or receive information.
A client is a node that accesses the network through a server.
All devices that can send, receive, and create information on a network are nodes.
The nodes that access servers to get on the network are known as clients.
The server controls the level of access that clients have.
If a client fails, the network remains unchanged.
Client-server networks are common in businesses.
They keep files up-to-date and easy-to-find by ensuring users work on one shared file
in one location.
Examples of services that use client-server networks include file transfer protocol sites,
or
FTP sites, web servers, and web browsers.
Peer-to-Peer networks are common in homes and on the Internet.
Examples include file sharing sites, discussion forums, media streaming, and voice over IP services,
also called VoIP services.
A hub connects multiple devices together in a network.
When data is sent to a hub, it broadcasts that data to all devices on the network except
for the one that sent the data.
A switch is similar to a hub except it keeps a table of MAC addresses.
When a switch receives any data, it looks up the proper MAC address and forwards the
data to the right place.
Switches are more efficient than hubs because they only send data to the intended recipient.
Switches and hubs connect to modems.
If a switch or a hub fails, it brings the entire network down.
Routers interconnect different networks or subnetworks.
A router serves two primary functions:
They manage traffic between networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses,
and they allow multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
Routers connect to modems.
To direct packets effectively, a router uses an internal routing table which is a list
of paths to various network destinations.
The router reads a packet's header to determine its path, consults the routing table to figure
out the most efficient path, then forwards the packet to the next network in the path.
A modem, or modulator/demodulator, converts data into a format that is easy to transmit
across a network.
Once that data reaches its destination, the receiving modem converts it back to its original
form.
The most common modems in use today are cable & DSL modems.
A bridge joins two separate computer networks so they can communicate with each other and
work as a single network.
Bridges can be wired or wireless.
Wireless bridges can support Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi to Ethernet, and Bluetooth to Wi-Fi
connections.
A gateway is hardware or software that allows data to flow from one network to another,
for example, a home network to the Internet.
Gateways are distinct from routers or switches in that they use multiple protocols to connect
multiple networks.
A repeater, or extender, receives a signal and retransmits it.
Repeaters are used to extend a wireless signal so it can cover longer distances or be received
on the other side of an obstruction like brick, steel, or concrete.
Repeaters connect to wireless routers.
A wireless access point, also known as WAP or AP, allows Wi-Fi devices to connect to
a wired network.
The WAP usually connects to a wired router as a standalone device.
The WAP can also act as a central wireless connection point for computers equipped with
wireless network adapters.
The WAP is plugged in to a wired network switch.
The WAP reads each computer's MAC address and forwards that to the wired switch.
If the wired network is connected to a router with internet access, the wireless network
will also have internet access.
Network Interface Cards or NICs connect individual devices to a network.
NICs can be wired or wireless.
Today's computers usually come with wireless NICs already built in.
Most include ports for network cables so users can easily connect their computer to a network.
A firewall monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined
security rules.
A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted
external network, like the Internet.
Firewalls can be either software or hardware.
Wireless routers and computer operating systems often have built-in firewalls.
A proxy server acts as an intermediary between a LAN and the Internet to minimize security
risks.
The proxy server evaluates requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate server
if those requests meet preset security requirements.
Proxy servers hide an IP address.
If an IP address is hidden, it cannot be tracked.
Proxy servers save bandwidth.
For example, a proxy server will download files or updates for the first user, then
keep them stored for any future users who need them.
An Intrusion Detection System, or IDS, monitors network traffic and reports malicious activity
to the network administrator.
An Intrusion Prevention System, or IPS, inspects network traffic and removes, detains, or redirects
malicious items based on rules set by the network administrator.
In this video, you learned:
Network devices, which can be a variety of different types, enable communication and
interaction on a network.
Servers are powerful computers that store files and applications, and are accessed by
other computers on the same network.
Nodes and clients can be configured in different ways.
Routers and modems transmit and convert data to ensure interconnections happen and information
reaches its destination correctly.
Firewalls, proxy servers, IDS, and IPS work to keep networks secure.

Wired and Wireless Network Connections

Welcome to "Wired and Wireless Network Connections."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
• Identify different types of older and newer Internet connections.
• Describe the pros and cons of wired and wireless Internet connections.
• And list the latest networking trends.
Older Internet connection types that use phone lines include dialup, integrated services
digital network or ISDN, and digital subscriber lines or DSL.:
• Dialup cannot use the phone and Internet at the same time.
• ISDN transmits data and phone conversations digitally.
• DSL is faster than dial-up and can use the phone and Internet at the same time.
Newer Internet connection types include cable and fiber optic.
Two wireless connections have also been developed, satellite and cellular:
• Cable uses the same coaxial cables as cable television and is one of the most common
connection types.
• Fiber optic relies on fiber-optic cables to transfer data with light waves instead
of electricity.
Fiber optic is the fastest connection type.
• Satellite relies on communication satellites.
Prevalent in remote and rural areas.
GPS technology relies on satellites for positioning data.
• Cellular uses the same channels as cellular phones and can connect anywhere.
It is also known as "WISP" for wireless Internet service providers.
Wired networking refers to the use of wire connections that allow users to communicate
over a network.
Most computer networks still depend on cables or wires to connect devices and transfer data.
Cable delivers Internet via copper coaxial television cable.
It is the best option for fast and reliable Internet if you don't have access to fiber-optic.
Some of the pros of cable include that it uses existing TV infrastructure to reduce
cost, it has high speeds that rival pure fiber in ideal implementations, it has greater bandwidth
than DSL in most cases, and its speeds are not substantially affected by distance from
the ISP office.
Cons include that you have to share bandwidth with your neighbors, it slows down during
peak times, its upload speeds are much slower than its download speeds, it is susceptible
to electromagnetic interference, and it has lower latency than DSL in most cases.
The last wired connection we will discuss is fiber optic cable.
Fiber optic transmits data by sending pulses of light across strands of glass at speeds
up to 200 gigabytes per second.
This connection rarely lags, which makes it perfect for HD streaming or online gaming.
Its pros include efficiency, reliable connections, great for long distances, fast speeds, and
good for high-definition streaming and gaming.
However, its cons include that it is both expensive and not yet readily available.
A wireless network is a network that lets users connect without cables.
Wireless networking is when people communicate and access applications and information without
being physically plugged in.
There are four main types of wireless networks: WPAN or Wireless Personal Area Network: 
Interconnects
devices in a short span, generally within a person's reach.
WLAN or Wireless Local Area Network: Links two or more devices using a wireless distribution
method, providing a connection to the wider Internet through access points.
WMAN or Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks: Connects several wireless LANs.
Generally used to cover an entire city.
WWAN or Wireless Wide Area Network: Covers large areas such as neighboring towns and
cities.
WPAN is used for peripheral devices: Bluetooth: radio communication that enables
low-power, short-distance wireless networking between phones, computers, and other network
devices.
RFID or radio frequency identification: communicates using electromagnetic or electrostatic 
coupling
to uniquely identify an object, animal, or person.
NFC or near field communication: a method of data transfer that allows short-range communication
between compatible devices.
IrDA or Infrared Data Association: a set of infrared communication protocols that provide
wireless, line-of-sight connectivity between devices.
Wired and wireless networks have different advantages and disadvantages.
The mobility you gain from a wireless network might mean putting up with higher costs and
additional security concerns.
Wired networks offer more speed and security, but installation may be more difficult.
Let's look at the latest networking trends: Wi-Fi 6 (Standard 802.11 ax): is an IEEE standard
for WLANs that brings faster throughput speeds, better battery life, and less bandwidth congestion
than what you get with Wi-Fi 5 technology.
Network Analytics- Leveraging AI for smarter insights.
When a disruption hits, NetOps teams need the help of advanced analytics to make smart
and timely decisions.
Network Analytics uses AI and Machine Learning to manage such disruptions and issues.
Network Automation - Automating operations for faster recovery
There's extraordinary strain on today's NetOps teams with unprecedented volume in
client counts, application traffic patterns, and new use cases (like e-learning, video
conferencing, virtual events, and remote care).
Network automation is critical to ensure continued service and performance.
SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) is a solution for today's combined networking and security
challenges.
Adopted in cloud or hybrid models, and in on-premises data centers.
In this video, you learned: Older Internet connection types, like Dialup,
ISDN, and DSL, are low-cost and offer low to medium speed.
Newer Internet connection types, like Satellite, Cable, Fiber Optic, and Cellular, are higher
in cost but offer useful features such as higher speed and mobility.
A wired network uses wired connections that allow users to communicate over a network.
A wireless network is a network that lets users connect without cables.
Two wireless technologies include cellular and satellite.
Wired connections like cable and fiber optic have gotten faster and stronger, but older
technology like dial-up and DSL still works if you need it.
Wireless connections are slower and less consistent than newer wired connections, but wireless
connections can be accessed almost anywhere and are easier to install and deploy.
New networking trends include the Wi-Fi 6 IEEE standard, Network Analytics and Automation,
and Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE.


(Optional) - Wired and Wireless SOHO Networks

Welcome to Wired and Wireless SOHO Networks.
After watching this video, you'll be able to describe the features of Wired and Wireless SOHO 
networks, list the requirements for setting up Wired and Wireless SOHO networks and explain how 
to configure, test and troubleshoot Wired and Wireless SOHO networks.
A small office, home office or SOHO network is a local area network or LAN with less than ten 
computers that serves a small physical space with a small number of employees or home users.
It can be a wired Ethernet LAN or a LAN made of both wired and wireless devices.
A typical wired SOHO network includes a router with a software based firewall, a switch with four 
to eight Ethernet LAN ports, a printer, and several desktops or laptops.
SOHO networks often use email, website and cloud subscription services, since maintenance and 
reliability are included.
Internet is provided via cable, DSL or ISDN.
Basic equipment maintenance is easy since there are only a handful of devices and cables to 
consider.
When setting up a SOHO network, knowing the compatibility requirements is very important.
The hardware, software, adapter cards and cables all need to be compatible for the network to 
function properly.
Before setting up any SOHO network, review and confirm everything in your plan to ensure a 
successful installation.
Soho networks need a switch to act as the hub of the network.
If Internet is desired, a router can be added or used instead.
SOHO routers often have other integrated features like a cable or DSL modem, switch ports, and a 
built in firewall.
A modem provides an Internet connection.
Ethernet cables provide a wired connection.
Category 5, 5e and 6 cables are the current standard.
A router automatically assigns IP addresses to each device on the network, which is necessary if you 
intend to share your Internet connection with all the connected devices.
And a SOHO network switch typically allows four to eight connected devices to talk to each other, 
but does not assign IP addresses or provide Internet.
Switches are best used to expand the number of LAN ports available on the network, since the 
number of ports on a router can be limited.
Set up the hardware in a SOHO network using the following steps.
Plug the switch or router into a power source.
Connect the switch to the router if necessary.
If you're using a switch and a router, plug one end of an Ethernet cable into any LAN port on the 
router and the other into any LAN port on the switch.
This will expand the network to the rest of the LAN ports on the switch.
Connect your modem to your router if necessary.
If you're sharing an Internet connection from a modem, connect the modem to the WAN Internet 
port on the router.
This is usually a different color than other ports.
Connect your computers to open LAN ports; use Ethernet cables to connect each computer to any 
LAN port on your router or switch.
Keep devices close to the router or switch since ethernet doesn't transfer data reliably over long 
distances (100 meters maximum).
A small office, home office or SOHO Wireless network is a wireless local area network, or WLAN, 
that serves a small physical space with a small number of employees or home users.
A SOHO wireless network can be configured with the help of a central wireless access point 
(WAP), which can cover a range of wireless devices within a small office or home.
SOHO networks often use email, website and cloud subscription services, since maintenance and 
reliability are included.
Basic equipment maintenance is easy since there are only a handful of devices and cables to 
consider.
Some common broadband types that enable network connection include:
Dynamic host configuration protocol or DHCP:
DHCP is the most common broadband type. It is used in cable modem connections.
PPPoE or Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet:
PPPoE is used in DSL connections in areas that don't have newer options.
Static IP: Static IP is more common in business.
DHCP is the easiest broadband type to use.
Internet service providers can provide other options if needed.
Wireless networks can be set up to be either open or encrypted.
Open networks are popular in public spaces because they don't require a password.
However, they are easily exploited because anyone can join.
Encrypted networks require a password before users can connect.
There are different types of WiFi encryption, the strongest being WPA2.
A captive portal is a web page pop up that authenticates users who try to log in to WiFi in places 
like apartment houses, hotel rooms and small business centers.
However, a captive portal is not a secure connection.
On the rear of a typical wireless router, you'll see several connections:
A power input jack.
One or more wired Ethernet jacks for wired connections.
(These may include a jack for broadband connection often labeled WAN or Internet.)
A USB port, which lets you connect a printer or external hard drive for sharing on the network.
And a WiFi on off button, which allows you to easily enable or disable a wireless network.
Once the router is configured, your wireless network is ready.
Users will see it among the available wireless networks when they click the WiFi icon located at the 
bottom right of PC screens and in the drop down menu of mobile devices.
Test network performance and Internet connectivity on each wireless device in the vicinity of the 
WAP.
If needed, troubleshoot performance issues like network lags, glitches or blocked access with the 
following actions.
First, check the router configuration settings.
Next, run security tools, check for updates, restart devices, run diagnostics, reboot router or modem, 
and finally, check your equipment for damage.
In this video, you learned that wired SOHO networks have a router, switch, printer, and connected 
devices.
Compatibility requirements are very important.
Physical setup includes connecting the router to the modem and a device to the router.
A SOHO wireless network is configured with a central wireless access point (WAP) to cover all 
wireless devices within a small home or office.
DHCP is the most common broadband type over PPPoE and Static IP.
WPA2 is the best encryption choice because it is the strongest.

Network Settings in Windows

Welcome to "Network Settings in Windows."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain where common network resources are in Windows.
List network tools available in Windows settings.
Describe when you would and wouldn't use a network reset.
Windows Settings is a key troubleshooting tool.
To get to it, type 'settings' in the Windows search bar.
From there you can select Network & Internet to access related information and tools.
You can get to this same location by right-clicking your start menu and selecting Network 
Connections.
When the Network status page loads, it shows the network you're connected to.
It also shows the Properties button and the Data usage button.
The Data usage button loads the Data usage subpage, which shows you how much data each
application has used on the network.
Here you can set a data limit and reset usage stats.
The Properties button loads the Network and Internet Properties subpage.
You can select the 'public' option to block access from other devices, or select the 'private' option 
makeing your device sharable when you're on a trusted private network.
You can create random hardware addresses to make device tracking difficult, and you can adjust 
metered connection settings to reduce data usage and set a data limit.
The Properties subpage, also shows you your network name, the type of wifi you're on, what 
network band you're using, your data transmission speed, your IP addresses, and information on 
your network router.
This information is useful in many scenarios.
As an example, when you are troubleshooting a network speed problem, you can use properties
to see if your
network is on a faster, shorter-range 5 GHz band, rather than a slower, longer-range 2.4
GHz band.
If you're farther away from a wireless signal, a 2.4 GHz band connection is better.
Back on the main Network status page, you can scroll down to advanced network settings
to adjust adapter options, configure sharing settings, and use the network troubleshooter tool.
You can also get a deeper view into hardware and connection properties, go to firewall settings, or 
perform a network reset.
Let's take a deeper look at advanced options.
The Network & Sharing Center has basic network information and tools, like:
The network name.
Network troubleshooter.
And the advanced sharing settings.
Advanced sharing settings let you choose the level of access each network type has for things like 
network discovery and the sharing of files and printers.
The Network troubleshooter is an automated tool that detects and helps fix common network
problems.
With a single click, the Network troubleshooter automatically searches for network issues
and provides solutions or guidance for further troubleshooting.
The hardware and connection properties subpage lists the name, type, status, MAC address,
DHCP information, default gateway, DNS servers, and IP addresses for a device's connections,
which can include wifi, Bluetooth, ethernet, and more.
Even when some of those connections are not active.
If you want to find out if the IP address for a connection is static or dynamic, this is where you look.
Here we see that DHCP is enabled, which means that the IP address is dynamic.
The Firewall & network protection page has firewall status information and firewall customization
settings.
You can see firewall status for each type of network you connect to, whitelist apps, adjust 
notification settings, and configure advanced settings.
The Network reset tool lets you restore original network settings.
This can be useful but should be avoided if a network has a detailed or custom setup because
you may have to reinstall and reconfigure network software and settings after the reset is completed.
As you can see, network information and troubleshooting tools are easy to find and work with in 
Windows Settings.
From network names to sharing settings, the Network & Internet section has the information
and tools you'll need to troubleshoot common network problems.
In this video, you learned that:
The Network status page shows the SSID and IP address for the connected network and provides
tools for troubleshooting and setup.
DHCP data and Default Gateway addresses can be found in hardware and connection properties.
Advanced sharing settings let you adjust network discovery and file and printer sharing.
Network reset restores a network back to its original settings.


Lesson Summary: Computer Networks
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	A computer network connects two or more computing devices so users can communicate 
and share resources.
•	The five network topologies are personal area network (PAN), local area network (LAN), 
metropolitan area network (MAN), wide area network (WAN), and wireless local area 
network (WLAN).
•	There are two networking models: open systems interconnection (OSI) and transmission 
control protocol/Internet protocol TCP/IP). OSI describes the functions of a networking 
system, whereas TCP/IP is a set of standards that allow computers to communicate on a 
network.
•	Different types of cables include hard-drive (SATA, IDE, SCSI), network (coaxial, fiber 
optic, and ethernet), serial, video (VGA, HDMI, mini-HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI), and 
multipurpose (USB, USB-C, Thunderbolt).
•	Newer internet connection types include satellite, cable, fiber optic, and cellular. Fiber optic 
cable offers the fastest connection, but cellular connections are becoming more powerful and 
do not require any type of wire for a user to connect.
•	In order to troubleshoot a small office/home office (SOHO) network, you should run 
security tools, check for updates, restart devices, run diagnostics, reboot the router or 
modem, and check equipment for damage.
•	Windows tool settings include the Network status page that shows the SSID and IP address 
for the connected network and provides tools for troubleshooting and setup; hardware and 
connection properties to manage DHCP data and the default gateway addresses; and 
advanced sharing settings that let you adjust network discovery and file and printer sharing. 
The Network reset restores a network to its original settings.

Types of Local Storage Devices

Welcome to "Types of Local Storage Devices."
After watching this video, you will be able to: List the difference between RAM and ROM.
Identify the different types of storage drives
and explain the differences between storage drives.
Random Access Memory (or RAM) and Read Only Memory
(or ROM) are computer hardware chips that store data.
RAM, or Volatile, Cache, or Temporary Memory:
Fetches data at a high-speed;
Only stores data for a short time;
And automatically deletes data if the device is shut off.
ROM, or Non-Volatile Memory:
Fetches data at slower speeds;
Stores larger amounts of data for as long as needed;
And keeps data, even if the device is shut off.
RAM is used for copy/paste, opening programs, and background processes
ROM is used for computer booting and process initialization.
A Hard Drive or Hard Disk Drive (also called HD or HDD) is a storage drive
made of spinning magnetic plates and a read/write head that reads or writes data.
HDDs are known for having:
A large storage capacity;
Speeds up to 200 MB/s;
And a tendency to overheat.
HDDs were the standard PC storage for decades.
They are best for large, archival activities.
A Solid-state Drive (SSD) is the fastest storage option.
It has no moving parts, doesn't need power to retain data, and can read, write, and fetch faster than 
any HDD (up to 7000 MB/s, as opposed to 200 MB/s with HDDs).
SSDs are the new standard for PC storage.
They are: Small; Fast; And durable; but also Expensive with limited capacity and they can fail 
suddenly.
SSDs are best for activities that require speed, like browsing online, or editing large files.
Solid-State Hybrid Drives (or SSHDs) integrate the speed of an SSD and the capacity of an HDD
into a single device. It decides what to store in solid-state vs hard-disk based on user activity.
SSHDs are:
Faster than HDDs; Offer better performance than HDDs; Cost less than pure SSDs; And have 
higher capacities than SSDs.
Hard drives and solid-state hybrid drives are sometimes referred to as Spinning Drives because they 
use spinning plates to read, write, and fetch data.
Optical Disk Drives, or ODDs, read, write, and store data on optical disks like DVDs, CDs, and 
BDs (or Blu-ray discs).
Optical disk drives use a laser to reflect light off a disc's surface so it can read the reflected light. 
The process is reversed when writing data to a disk.
Optical Disk Drives are also called:
CD Drives;
DVD Drives;
BD Drives;
Disc Drives;
And Optical Drives.
Optical drives are best for reading large media files stored on discs.
Flash Drives store data on solid-state drives.
Less energy is needed to run flash drives as they don't have moving parts that require cooling.
High-end versions deduplicate and compress data to save space.
Flash drives are:
Small; Fast; And inexpensive to run. But they have smaller capacity than hard disk drives and are 
expensive to purchase.
Flash comes in multiple form factors, including USB thumb drives and Digital memory cards.
Flash is best for activities that require speed, like browsing online, or editing files .

In this video, you learned that:
RAM is used for fast, short-term computer memory, and ROM is used for slower, longer-term 
computer memory.
SSDs are faster and more efficient than HDDs.
Hybrid Drives offer the speeds of SSDs with the high capacity of HDDs.
Optical drives can read or write to discs like CDs and Blu-rays.

Types of Hosted Storage and Sharing

Welcome to "Types of Hosted Storage and Sharing."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain how Storage as a Service works.
Describe what a repository is and how it's used.
And list the benefits of Active Directory.
Storage as a Service (or STaaS) is when companies sell network storage space to customers.
This saves their customers from having to purchase and maintain network equipment.
Dropbox, OneDrive,
Google Drive, Box, and
Amazon Drive
are all examples of Storage as a Service.
Most email today is stored in the cloud.
Companies store your data, emails, and attachments in their data centers.
The same is true for social media storage.
Companies store your photos,
videos, and messages in their data centers.
Security and data retention policies vary.
Gmail will recover deleted email for 30 days before permanent removal.
Facebook deletes after 90 days but keeps certain user data indefinitely.
A workgroup or homegroup is a group of computers on a SOHO network, typically without a 
server.
To share files and folders, users set them to 'public'
Data is stored on the user device that created it.
The added points of failure create higher risk of data loss.
Newer Cloud solutions provide the same features more securely.
Workgroups and homegroups are less common.
Homegroups have been removed from Windows 10 altogether.
A repository is a network location that lets users store, manage, track, collaborate on, and control 
changes to their code.
Repositories save every draft and users can roll things back if problems occur.
This can save software developers months of time.
Examples of repositories include:
GitHub and Docker Hub.
Active Directory is a Microsoft technology that manages domain elements such as users and 
computers.
It organizes domain structure, grants network access, and connects to external domains.
It can be managed remotely from multiple locations.
Active Directory Domain Services (or AD DS) are the core services behind Active Directory.
AD DS:
Stores centralized data, and manages communication and search.
Authenticates users so they can access encrypted content.
Manages single sign on user authentication.
And limits content access via encryption.
Network drives are installed on a network and shared with selected users.
They offer the same data storage and services as a standard disk drive.
Network drives can be located anywhere.
They can be in the same room as a network user, or thousands of miles away.
Network drives appear alongside local drives.
Network drives can be installed on:
computers,
servers,
NAS units,
or portable drives.
File and Printer Sharing is part of the Microsoft Networks service.
It allows computers on the network to access shared files and printers.
Network drives appear alongside local drives or are accessed via a web browser.
Network printers appear in the printer options popup.

In this video, you learned that:
Storage as a Service (STaaS) allows users to benefit from a robust network infrastructure without 
having to first build and maintain it.
Software developers use repositories to store and collaborate on code, and have all drafts saved in 
case they need to revert to an earlier version.
Active Directory organizes domain and network elements and manages access to content.
And network File and Print Sharing provides common, central resources to users on a network.

Network Storage Types

Welcome to "Network Storage Types."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain what a SAN does.
Explain what a NAS does.
And list the differences between NAS and SAN.
Network storage is digital storage that all users on a network can access.
Small networks might rely on a single device for the storage needs of 1-5 people.
Large networks (like the internet) must rely on hundreds of datacenters full of servers.
A Storage Area Network, or SAN, combines servers, storage systems, switches, software, and 
services to provide secure, robust data transfers.
SANs: Have better application performance.
Are central and consolidated.
Are offsite so data is protected and ready for recovery.
And include simple, centralized management of connections and settings.
A Network Attached Storage, or NAS, device is a local file server.
It acts as a hard drive for all devices on a local network.
NAS devices provide: Convenient sharing across network devices.
Better performance through RAID configuration, remote access, and they work when the Internet
is down.
A NAS is a connected storage device that is local to the network it serves.
A SAN is a storage system that involves many devices and connections across multiple sites.
NAS devices are: Attached to a single site, less expensive, easier to manage, they appear as a 
network-attached drive, use Ethernet, do not scale, and have a single point of failure.
SANs: Can span multiple sites, are more expensive, harder to manage,
they appear as a local drive, use fiber, are easily scalable, and are fault tolerant.

In this video, you learned that: NAS is a local device that acts as a file
server for all devices on a local network.
A SAN is a complete networking system that enables efficient and secure storage.
And NAS and SAN are different because NAS is
local to its network while a SAN is a storage system that spans multiple offsite locations
and involves many devices, servers, and connections.

Troubleshooting Storage Issues

Welcome to "Troubleshooting Storage Issues."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe common causes of storage failures.
Explain the troubleshooting steps for various storage types.
Investigate and resolve slow performance.
Disk failure or hard drive failure can be caused by wear and tear over time, faulty
manufacturing, or power loss (especially when the disk is reading or writing).
Here are some symptoms of disk failure.
With read/write failure, you get an error message when you open or save a file.
Blue Screen of Death (or BSoD) is a system STOP error caused by a severe read/write failure.
A Bad sectors error means that part of a disk is unreliable and needs to be fixed.
Constant LED activity (or disk thrashing) may indicate insufficient RAM, with data moving
back and forth between RAM and the hard disk.
A clicking or grinding noise is a sign of a problem.
When you see these symptoms, replace the disk to avoid data loss.
The chkdsk tool and the SMART program are used to monitor and troubleshoot disk health.
SMART or Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology can be set to send an alert when
a disk is unreliable.
Check disk tools find bad sectors and fix system errors.
A check disk run test (chkdsk /r) locates bad sectors each time it is run.
You can use check disk fix (chkdsk /f) to fix file system errors, but it won't find
bad sectors.
Additional diagnostic programs are available from software and hardware vendors or may
come prepackaged with certain systems.
When a computer fails to boot, the first step is to check for lights and sounds associated
with power up.
If these don't come on, check to see if the device is plugged in.
If the device powers up but still does not boot, check the drive configuration to ensure
that: Firmware system setup has the correct boot
sequence, and no removable disks are present.
Data cables are connected to the drive correctly and free from damage.
Motherboard port is not disabled by system setup.
If the drive configuration is fine, it may be a filesystem error.
Use the Windows setup disc to boot into the recovery environment and enter "C:" in
the command prompt.
If it says, "Invalid media type", try the bootrec tool, or reformat the disk (erases
all data).
If it says, "invalid drive specification", check the partition structure with diskpart.
Errors like "Invalid drive specification" or "OSS not found" indicate boot errors.
Boot errors are caused by disk corruption, incorrect OS installation, or viruses.
To resolve: Try your antivirus software's boot disk
option to detect potential viruses.
Then use the antivirus software's recovery disk option, if available.
If the problem persists, boot with the original product disk and choose Repair.
Try Startup Repair first, or use the command prompt to:
Try fixing MBR.
Try fixing boot sector, or to try correcting missing installations in
the Boot Configuration Database then restart.
For computers that won't boot, you can try to recover files by removing the hard drive
and connecting it to another computer.
External enclosure kits let you secure the removed drive and connect it to other computers
using a USB cable.
If possible, Inspect and recover the drive's files via Windows Disk Management.
Or use chdsk to restore fragments of corrupted files, but keep in mind that third-party file
recovery software may work better.
Disk performance can slow If a disk is older, too full, or its files are not optimized for
fast access.
To improve performance: Defragment the drive for faster file access.
Add RAM.
Upgrade to a solid state drive or hybrid drive.
Remove files and applications, or add additional drive space.
Optical drives are laser-based and don't physically touch disks.
Here are some useful optical drive tips: Cleaning kits can often resolve common read/write
errors.
CD-ROM drives cannot read DVD-ROM disks.
Third-party software is available for DVD and Blu-Ray disk support.
Writable disks have recommended write speeds that affect quality and vary depending on
the brand.
When the OS is too slow for the optical drive's write process (buffer underrun), errors occur.
To fix this issue: Use the latest CD and DVD writers.
Burn at a lower write speed.
Close all other applications when burning, or copy data to the hard drive instead of
to disk.
Here are some common RAID troubleshooting steps:
If a RAID array is not detected at setup or boot, ensure RAID controller drivers are installed
and verify status.
If the configuration tool is unavailable, the controller may have failed.
If a RAID disk fails, you will get an alert.
If the RAID array supports redundant drives and hot swapping, just insert a new drive,
and then rebuild array with the configuration tool.
Performance is impacted during the RAID array rebuilding process as it commonly involves
large data transfers.
Take care to only remove the failed disk.
Removing a healthy disk can also cause a RAID array to fail.
If too many disks fail, use backup and recovery solutions.
A non-redundant RAID failure (like RAID 0) means both disk and data are lost.
If the controller fails, install a new controller or import the disks into another system.

In this video, you learned that: Disk failure is caused by faulty manufacturing,
wear and tear over time, or power loss.
Disk integrity is checked with chkdsk and SMART.
In boot failure, first, check for power up (lights and sounds), then drive configuration.
Space, RAM, or new drives improves performance.
Fast write speeds cause optical drive errors.
Rebuilding a RAID array slows performance.
Removing a healthy disk can cause RAID failure.

Lesson Summary: Storage and Sharing
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	RAM and ROM are both types of storage. Random access memory (RAM) fetches data at a 
high-speed, stores data for a short time, and automatically deletes data if the device is shut 
off. Read-only memory (ROM) stores larger amounts of data for as long as needed and 
keeps data, even if the device is shut off.
•	A repository is a network location that allows users to store, manage, track, collaborate on, 
and control changes to their code. Examples of repositories include GitHub and Docker 
Hub.
•	Network-attached storage (NAS) and storage area network (SAN) are two types of network 
storage. A SAN provides storage by combining servers, storage systems, switches, software, 
and services to provide secure, robust data transfers and better application performance. 
SANs are central and consolidated. They are housed offsite, so data is protected and ready 
for recovery. SANs include simple, centralized management of connections and settings. A 
NAS device is a local file server that acts as a hard drive for all devices on a local network. 
NAS devices are convenient for sharing across network devices, have better performance 
through RAID configuration, and work when the Internet is down.

check disk run test locates bad sectors each time it is run. You can use the check disk fix to 
fix file system errors, but it won't find bad sectors.

Glossary 3

Welcome! This alphabetized glossary contains many of the terms in Module 3. This comprehensive 
glossary also includes additional industry-recognized terms not used in course videos. These terms 
are important for you to recognize when working in the industry, participating in user groups, and 
participating in other certificate programs.
Term
Definition
802.11 Modes
Each country determines the band usage and the available 802.11 modes. 
The supported modes for the 2.4 GHz band are 802.11 (b/g/n). And the 
supported modes for the 5 GHz band are 802.11 (a/n/ac). Every router has a 
default option that supports all types. If you are unsure which modes are 
supported, select the default one.
Access point (AP)
(See Wireless access point)
Active Directory 
(AD)
Microsoft technology manages domain elements such as users and 
computers. It organizes domain structure, grants network access, and 
connects to external domains. Users can manage it remotely from multiple 
locations.
Active Directory 
Domain Services 
(AD DS)
The core services behind Active Directory, AD DS stores centralized data, 
manages communication and search, authenticates users to access encrypted 
content, manages single sign-on user authentication, and limits content 
access via encryption.
Archival Storage
A type of storage that moves data out of regular production file areas into 
long-term storage. Archival storage can be easily accessed and brought back 
into regular use. It can be done with tape drives, which are best for large 
backups, flash storage, hard drives, and cloud solutions. It is low cost and 
high capacity.
Airplane Mode
Toggles Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular on or off
Backups and 
Snapshots
Backups are copies of files, operating systems, settings, and more stored in a 
separate location in case of disk failure or data loss. Snapshots do the same 
thing as backups but are usually used in storage arrays or SANs at an 
enterprise level and are more focused on capturing a point in time. All 
snapshots start with a full backup. A full backup or snapshot copies 
everything on a disk selected for backup. A differential backup or snapshot 
copies only the files that changed since the last full backup. An incremental 
backup or snapshot copies only the files that changed since any backup. 
Backups and snapshots can be automated or manual. If you delete the 
original instance of the data, only manual backups are retained. With 
essential data, keeping three backups or snapshots saved locally and in the 
cloud is best. Sometimes data can become corrupted. Backups and snapshots 
should be tested periodically to ensure they can still restore the data.
Bad Sectors
The corrupted disk areas indicate a partial disk failure and a "bad sectors" 
error message displays when this occurs.
Block Storage
A type of storage that splits data into fixed blocks and stores them with 
unique identifiers. Blocks can be stored in different environments (like one 
block in Linux and the rest in Windows). When a block is retrieved, it's 
reassembled with associated blocks to recreate the original data. Block 
storage is the default storage for frequently updated data; it is fast, reliable, 
and easy to change; it has no metadata, is not searchable, and is expensive; 
and it's often used in databases and email servers.
Blue Screen of 
Death (BSOD)
An error screen that indicates a system crash caused by a disk failure, BSOD 
is a severe read/write error.
Bluetooth
A type of radio communication that enables low-power, short-distance 
wireless networking between phones, computers, and other network devices.

operating system (OS) starts.
Boot Error
An error that indicates disk corruption, incorrect OS installation, or viruses, 
Examples of boot errors include "invalid drive specification" or "OSS not 
found." Boot errors are resolved with antivirus tools, repair tools included 
with the original product disk or boot file, or command prompt tools like 
MBR or boot sector.
Bridge
A device that joins two separate computer networks so they can 
communicate with each other and work as a single network. Bridges can be 
wired or wireless. Wireless bridges can support Wi-Fi-to-Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi-to-
Ethernet, and Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi connections.

modems. Coaxial cables contain an inner copper wire surrounded by 
insulation and other shielding. They are highly resistant to signal interference 
and can support greater cable lengths between network devices than twisted-
pair Ethernet cables. The co-ax cable has a 10 Mbps capacity.
Computer Network
An array of connected devices like laptops, servers, smartphones, security 
cameras, door locks, doorbells, thermostats, and more; Computer networks 
enable data transfer and resource sharing. There are six common network 
types, which are usually distinguished by their range. They include PAN, 
LAN, MAN, WAN, WLAN, and VPN.

including publicly available documentation. Examples include HTTP, 
HTML, IP, and Ethernet 802.3d.
De-facto standards
They are standards that result from marketplace domination or practice. De-
facto standards are accepted in practice but have not undergone any formal 
process to obtain consensus and may not have publicly available 
documentation. Typically, de facto standards result from marketplace 
domination or practice. Examples include Microsoft Windows and 
QWERTY keyboard.

moderately high storage needs. External drives are portable DAS that 
connect to your computer via USB.
Disk Failure, or 
Hard Drive Failure
A situation when a disk or hard drive malfunctions, causing data to become 
corrupted, unreadable, or unwritable. Disk failure can be caused by wear and 
tear over time, faulty manufacturing, or power loss.
Disk Thrashing
Data moving back and forth from RAM to the hard disk indicates a disk 
failure or insufficient RAM. Constant LED activity on a device may indicate 
disk thrashing.
DHCP Automatic 
allocation

Domain Name 
System. (DNS)
A protocol that resolves or translates domain names to IP addresses. The 
default port for DNS is 53. DNS is a server that records all the URLs and IP 
addresses associated with one another. When you type a URL, like 
www.google.com, into a browser and press enter, the browser sends the URL 
to the DNS server. The DNS server replies with the proper IP address. Your 
browser will connect to the IP address provided. Because number-only IP 
addresses are not as easy for people to remember, DNS translates easy-to-
remember web addresses to number-only addresses, ensuring that network 
devices and those using them know where they're going. (Also called 
Domain Name Service and Domain Name Server.)
Drive Configuration

Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP)
A protocol that automates configuring IP network devices, the easiest and 
most common broadband type to use. Internet Service Providers can provide 
other options if needed. It is used in cable modem connections. A DHCP 
server uses a pool of reserved IP addresses to automatically assign dynamic 
IP addresses or allocate a permanent IP address to a device. The default ports 
for DHCP are 67 and 68.
Dynamic IP 
addresses
IP addresses that are automatically assigned. They change every time the 
device connects to a network or changes location.
Encrypted Wireless 
Networks

different types of Wi-Fi encryption, the strongest being WPA2.
Ephemeral Storage
A storage configuration that deletes saved data on restart; It resets things to 
their original state even if settings, updates, and files are adjusted and saved. 
You may use it in application demos and OS restarts in computer labs. You 
can configure storage settings in DAS units and other storage devices as 
temporary or persistent.
Ethernet ('twisted-
pair) Cables
Cables that consist of four pairs of twisted wires to reduce interference. 
These cables 'hardwire' a computer to a LAN. Hardwiring is faster and more 
consistent than Wi-Fi. They are available in two types - shielded wires or 
unshielded wires. Unshielded Twisted Pair, or UTP, cables are cheaper and 
more common. Shielded Twisted Pair, or STP, cables are more expensive and 
designed to reduce outside interference that might interrupt data 
transmission. Ethernet cables also have category numbers. A higher category 
number means the cable is newer and usually faster with better bandwidth. 
Category, distance, and bandwidth are considered when building networks 
using Ethernet. There are many types and categories of ethernet cables, and 
while all of them use the same connector on both ends, mixing up, types can 
damage cables or hardware.
External Enclosure 
Kit

strands of glass (up to 200 Gbps). Fast, reliable, and consistent. This 
connection rarely lags, which makes it perfect for HD streaming or online 
gaming.
Fiber Optic Cables
Used in wide area networks, or WANs, because they work over long 
distances without much interference and can handle a heavy volume of data 
traffic. Different types of fiber optic cables are used depending on the cost 
and the amount of bandwidth the cable can support. There are two basic 
types of fiber cables: single-mode and multi-mode.
File Gateway
A type of storage gateway that acts as a file server in the cloud that stores 
data files using the S3, NFS, and SMB protocols. The S3, or Simple Storage 
Service, protocol enables the storage of block data in categories called 
"buckets." The NFS, or Network File System, protocol enables server-to-
server file sharing. And SMB, or Server Message Block, enables file and 
print sharing for network users.
File Sharing
A part of the Microsoft Networks service, It allows computers on the 
network to access shared files. Network drives appear alongside local drives 
or are accessed via a web browser.
File Storage
A type of storage that saves all data in a single file and is organized by a 
hierarchical path of folders and subfolders. File storage uses app extensions 
like .jpg,.doc, or .mp3. File storage is familiar and easy for most users, has 
user-level customization, is expensive, and is hard to manage at larger scales.
File Transfer 
Protocol (FTP)
A protocol that is responsible for file transfer, FTP transfers files to and from 
an FTP server or client. The default port for FTP is 21.
Firewall
A device that uses predetermined security rules to monitor and control 
incoming and outgoing network traffic. A firewall typically establishes a 
barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external network, 
like the Internet. Firewalls can be either software or hardware. Wireless 
routers and computer operating systems often have built-in firewalls.
Flash Drive
A storage drive that stores data on solid-state drives, running flash drives 
requires less energy as they don't have moving parts that require cooling. 
High-end versions deduplicate and compress data to save space. Flash drives 
are small, fast, and inexpensive to run. But they have a smaller capacity than 
hard disk drives and are expensive. Flash comes in multiple form factors, 
including USB thumb drives and digital memory cards. Flash is best for 
activities that require speed, like browsing online or editing files.
Full-duplex
In full-duplex mode, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously, 
like a phone or a messaging app.
Gateway
Hardware or software that allows data to flow from one network to another, 
for example, a home network to the Internet. Gateways are distinct from 
routers or switches because they use multiple protocols to connect networks.
Half-duplex
In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at 
the same time. Like a walkie-talkie.
Hard Drive / Hard 
Disk Drive (HD / 
HDD)
A storage drive made of spinning magnetic plates and a read/write head that 
reads or writes data. HDDs are known for having a large storage capacity, 
speeds up to 200 MB/s, and a tendency to overheat. HDDs were the standard 
PC storage for decades. They are best for large archival activities. Hard 
drives and solid-state hybrid drives are sometimes called spinning drives 
because they use spinning plates to read, write, and fetch data.
Hard Drive Cables
Cables like SATA, IDA, and SCSI connect a hard drive (default storage) to a 
motherboard or controller card (a central processing unit or CPU). The same 
cables may also be used to connect optical drives and older floppy drives.

employ a single IP address use NAT, as do most home routers. NAT 
conserves public IP addresses and improves security. When data packets 
arrive at the public IP address, the NAT instructions send all data packets 
without revealing the private IP addresses of the intended destinations. That 
single network device is an intermediary between private and Internet 
networks.

on a local network. A NAS is a connected storage device that is local to the 
network it serves. NAS devices provide convenient sharing across network 
devices and better performance through RAID configuration and remote 
access, and they work when the Internet is down. NAS devices are attached 
to a single site, are less expensive, easier to manage, appear as a network-
attached drive, use Ethernet, do not scale, and have a single point of failure.
Network 
Automation
They are automating operations for faster recovery. Network engineers code 
automated responses to simple tasks to help speed up service and 
performance.
Network Cables
Cables like coaxial, fiber optic, and Ethernet connect devices and transmit

information from one network device to another. A network's topology, 
protocol, and size determine the type of network cable(s) needed.
Network devices or 
networking 
hardware
Physical devices that enable communication and interaction on a computer 
network include cables, servers, desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and 
the Internet of Things or IoT devices.

wireless. Today's computers usually come with wireless NICs already built 
in. Most include ports for network cables so users can easily connect their 
computers to a network.
Network 
Performance
The way a network functions. Network performance depends on Internet 
strength, cable specification, installation quality, connected devices, and 
network and software settings.
Network protocol
An established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between 
different devices in the same network. Network protocols are typically 
created according to industry standards. There are thousands of different 
network protocols, but they all perform one of three primary actions: 
Security, Communication, and Network Management.
Network Storage
Digital storage that all users on a network can access. Small networks might 
rely on a single device for the storage needs of 1-5 people. Large networks 
(like the Internet) must rely on hundreds of data centers full of servers.
Network Topology

communication between the source and destination systems. Data packets 
follow network model protocols.
Networking 
standards
Engineers use Widely accepted protocols to ensure the things they build 
integrate with existing devices & technology. They define the rules for data 
communications needed for the interoperability of networking technologies 
and processes. Standards are usually created by government or non-profit 
organizations for the betterment of an entire industry. This ensures broader 
compatibility across vendors and industries. There are two types of network 
standards: de facto and de jure.
Near field 
communication 
(NFC)
Data transfer method that allows short-range communication between 
compatible devices
Node

a node that accesses the network through a server. All devices that send, 
receive, and create information on a network are nodes.
Object Storage
A type of storage that divides data into self-contained units stored at the 
same level. There are no subdirectories like in file storage. Object storage 
uses metadata for fast searching. Each object has a unique number, requires 
an API to access and manage objects, is a good choice for large amounts of 
unstructured data, and is an important storage option for AI, machine 
learning, and big data analytics.
Open Wireless

However, they are easily exploited because anyone can join.
Optical Disk Drive 
(ODD)
A storage drive that reads, writes, and stores data on optical disks like DVDs, 
CDs, and Blu-ray discs (BDs). Optical disk drives use a laser to reflect light 
off a disk's surface to read the reflected light. The process is reversed when 
writing data to a disk. Optical disk drives are CD, DVD, BD, disc, and 
optical drives. Optical drives are best for reading large media files stored on 
disks.
OSI Model
A conceptual framework describes a networking system's functions; Data 
flows across layers when communicating over a network. The seven layers 
of the OSI model include Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, 
Network, Data Link, and Physical.
Packet
A digital package of information that can be sent across a network; When 
you send an email, it is broken down into individually labeled data packets. 
The packets travel independently over the network and arrive at their 
destination in no set order. They are then recompiled in the correct order to 
produce the original message. This is also how you receive websites in your 
browser. (Also called: frames, blocks, cells, or segments.)
Peer-to-Peer 
networks
Common in homes and on the Internet. Peer-to-peer networks allow users to 
share resources and information. Examples include file-sharing sites, 
discussion forums, media streaming, and voice-over IP, or VoIP, services.
Persistent Storage
A storage configuration that keeps saved data on restart. It behaves like the 
storage you're used to in your everyday computer. It is used in things like 
personal computers and network archives. Most storage drives are 
configured to use persistent storage. You can configure storage settings in 
DAS units and other devices as temporary or persistent.
Personal Area 
Network (PAN)
A network that enables communication between devices around a person; 
PANs can be wired or wireless and utilize technologies like USB, infrared, 
ZigBee, and Bluetooth.
Ping
A diagnostic command prompt utility that checks the connection status 
between two points.
Point-to-Point 
Protocol over 
Ethernet (PPPoE)
A broadband type used in DSL connections in areas that don't have newer 
options
Ports
The first and last stop for information sent across a network, A port is a 
communication endpoint. A port always has an associated protocol and 
application. The protocol is the path that leads to the application's port. A 
network device can have up to 65,536 ports. Port numbers do not change.
Post Office Protocol 
version 3 (POP3)
An older protocol was the standard for receiving an email with POP3, the 
email is downloaded from an email server to a single device, and then the 
email is deleted from the server. The default port for POP3 is 110.
Printer Sharing
A part of the Microsoft Networks service that allows computers on the 
network to access shared printers, Network printers appear in the printer 
options popup.
Private Cloud
A cloud solution that provides collaboration and access to private network 
users
Private IP address
They are used to connect securely within an internal, private network. It does 
not connect to the Internet.
Proprietary
A vendor-specific wireless municipal network with proprietary standards and 
equipment
Proxy server
A device that acts as an intermediary between a LAN and the Internet to 
minimize security risks. The proxy server evaluates client requests and 
forwards them to the appropriate server if they meet preset security 
requirements. Proxy servers hide an IP address. If an IP address is hidden, it 
cannot be tracked. Proxy servers save bandwidth. For example, a proxy 
server will download files or updates for the first user, then keep them stored 
for any future users who need them.
Public Cloud
A cloud solution that provides offsite storage for Internet users
Public IP address
The IP address a device uses to communicate publicly outside of the local 
network. It connects to the Internet.
Radio Firmware
A software that manages cellular, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, and NFC 
connections
Radio frequency 
identification 
(RFID)
Communicates using electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling to uniquely 
identify an object, animal, or person.
RAID 0, or Striping
A storage array and configuration that splits data into storage units called 
"blocks" and stores those across two or more drives in an array. RAID 0 is 
fast and has 100% usable disk capacity, but is not fault tolerant. If one drive 
fails, all data is lost. RAID 0 is popular with gamers and photographers who 
need to save large amounts of data quickly.
RAID 1, or 
Mirroring
A storage array and configuration that copies and stores data twice across 
two or more drives. RAID 1 cuts space to 50% usable capacity, and if one 
drive fails, no data is lost.
RAID 10
A storage array and configuration that combines RAID 0 and RAID 1. It 
strips or spreads data across drives that are part of the array. RAID 10 is fast, 
fault-tolerant, and if three drives fail, all data is lost.
RAID 5, or Striping 
with Parity
A storage array and configuration is the most common form of RAID. It 
splits data into blocks and stores those across three or more drives. If data 
loss occurs, the computer will recalculate the lost data using error-checking 
tags known as parity bits stored across the drives. RAID 5 is fast, fault-
tolerant, and if one drive fails, no data is lost.
Random Access 
Memory (RAM)
A computer hardware chip fetches data at high speed, only stores data for a 
short time, and automatically deletes data if the device is shut off. RAM is 
used for copying/pasting, opening programs, and background processes. 
(Also known as volatile, cache, or temporary memory.)
Read/Write Failure
A disk failure that results in not being able to open or save a file. A 
"read/write failure" error message displays when this occurs.
Read-Only Memory 
(ROM)
A computer hardware chip fetches data at slower speeds, stores larger 
amounts of data for as long as needed, and keeps data, even if the device is 
shut off. ROM is used for computer booting and process initialization. (Also 
known as non-volatile memory.)
Redundant Array of 
Independent Disks 
(RAID)
A storage array and configuration that spreads data across multiple storage 
drives working in parallel. RAID devices can use SSDs, HDDs, and hybrid 
drives. Companies choose RAID devices for their durability and 
performance. Multiple drive failure is rare, but it happens. Maintaining 
RAID devices, keeping spare drives handy in case of drive failure, and 
having a backup routine will make data loss nearly impossible.
Remote Desktop 
Protocol (RDP)
A protocol remotely controls another computer via a graphical user interface 
(or GUI). The default port for RDP is 3389.
Repository
A network location that lets users store, manage, track, collaborate on, and 
control changes to their code. Repositories save every draft; users can roll 
things back if problems occur. This can save software developers months. 
Examples of repositories include GitHub and Docker Hub.
Reserved IP 
addresses
Addresses that the IETF and the IANA have reserved for special purposes.
Reset
When you restore the default state of an operating system, application, or 
network, resets can resolve networking issues but are a last resort because 
settings and configurations are lost during a reset.
Restart
When you close or shut down a network, a device, or software, open it again 
or turn it back on again. Sometimes a restart can help resolve network issues.
Repeater, or 
extender
A device that receives a signal and retransmits it. Repeaters are used to 
extend a wireless signal so it can cover longer distances or be received on the 
other side of an obstruction like brick, steel, or concrete. Repeaters connect 
to wireless routers.
Ring Topology 
network
Connects all devices in a circular ring pattern where data only flows in a 
clockwise direction. Each device receives and passes on the data until it 
reaches the intended recipient device, which then processes it. Ring topology 
works better in smaller networks.
Router
A device that interconnects different networks or subnetworks, Routers 
manage network traffic by forwarding data packets to their intended IP 
addresses, allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection. 
Routers connect to modems. A router uses an internal routing table to direct 
packets effectively, a list of paths to various network destinations. The router 
reads a packet's header to determine its path, consults the routing table to 
figure out the most efficient path, then forwards the packet to the next 
network in the path.
Satellite
A newer connection type that relies on communication satellites, satellites 
are popular in remote and rural areas.
Secure Access 
Service Edge 
(SASE)
A solution for today's combined networking and security challenges; adopted 
in the cloud or hybrid models and on-premises data centers
Secure File Transfer 
Protocol (SFTP)
A protocol responsible for encrypted file transfer; the default port for SFTP 
is 22.
Self-monitoring, 
Analysis, and 
Reporting 
Technology 
(SMART)
A disk health monitoring program can send an alert when a disk is 
unreliable.
Secure Shell (SSH)
A protocol is used to securely control another device via console or 
command shell with encryption. SSH uses encryption to secure remote data. 
The default port for SSH is 22, which is the same port that SFTP uses since 
they both offer similar, secured services.
Serial Advanced 
Technology 
Attachment (SATA)
The next-generation hard drive cable, SATA, carries high-speed data and 
connects to storage devices (hard disk, optical, and solid-state drives).
Serial Cable
They transfer information between two devices using the RS-232 standard, 
which states that data bits must flow in a line, one after another, over the 
cable. Serial cables are used in modems, keyboards, mice, and other 
peripheral devices, which is why serial cables are sometimes called 
"peripheral cables." However, video and multipurpose cables are also called 
"peripheral cables" for the same reason, even though they might not use the 
RS-232 standard.
Server Message 
Block (SMB)
A protocol that enables sharing files and printers on the network. The default 
ports for SMB are 137 through 139.
Service Set 
Identifier (SSID)
The name of a wireless network is chosen during the setup of a wireless 
network. Choosing a unique name to distinguish your router from nearby 
wireless routers is a good idea. Users will see a network's SSID among the 
available wireless networks when they click the Wi-Fi icon at the bottom-
right of PC screens and in the drop-down menu of mobile devices.
Simple Mail 
Transfer Protocol 
(SMTP)
A protocol responsible for sending emails; the default port for SMTP is 25.
Simple Network 
Management 
Protocol (SNMP)
A protocol that monitors the network; The default port for SNMP is 161.
Simplex
In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, where one of the two 
devices on a link can only transmit but not receive, and the other only 
receive but not send, like a radio or a keyboard.
Single-mode Fiber 
Optic Cable
A fiber optic cable that carries only one light path is typically sourced by a 
laser. It has a much longer transmission distance.
Single sign-on 
(SSO)
A technology that lets you use a single ID to log in to multiple apps from any 
device. Tech companies provide SSO to give users easy access to cloud-
synced apps and files.
Small Computer 
System Interface 
(SCSI)
They are designed to support a wide variety of device types. This means 
there are different types of SCSI cables. They may be ribbon or standard 
round cables of 50, 68, or 80 wires. Up to 16 devices, including the 
motherboard or SCSI controller card, may be connected to one SCSI cable or 
daisy-chained together.
Snapshots
(See Backups and Snapshots.)
SOHO Network 
Router
A router that automatically assigns IP addresses to each network device is 
necessary if you intend to share your Internet connection with all the 
connected devices.
SOHO Network 
Security (wired)
It primarily depends on a firewall since all data packets in a wired network 
travel through secure Ethernet cables. Most broadband routers have a built-in 
firewall, and additional software firewalls can be installed on individual 
machines.
SOHO Network 
Switch
Allows 4 to 8 connected devices to talk to each other but does not assign IP 
addresses or provide Internet. Switches are best used to expand the number 
of LAN ports available on the network since the number of ports on a router 
can be limited.
SOHO Wired 
Network (Small 
Office/Home Office)
A local area network, or LAN, with less than ten computers, It can be wired 
or wireless. SOHO networks need a switch to act as the hub of the network. 
If the Internet is desired, a router can be used instead. SOHO routers often 
have other integrated features, like a cable or DSL modem, switch ports, and 
a built-in firewall. A modem provides an Internet connection. Ethernet 
Cables provide a wired connection. Category 5, 5E, and six cables are the 
current standard. Since maintenance and reliability are included, SOHO 
networks often use email, website, and cloud subscription services. Internet 
is provided via cable, DSL, or ISDN. Basic equipment maintenance is easy 
since there are only a handful of devices and cables to consider.
SOHO Wireless 
Network (Small 
Office/Home Office)
A wireless local area network, or WLAN, serves a small physical space with 
many employees or home users. A SOHO wireless network can be 
configured with the help of a central wireless access point, or WAP, which 
can cover a range of wireless devices within a small office or home. Since 
maintenance and reliability are included, SOHO networks often use email, 
website, and cloud subscription services. Basic equipment maintenance is 
easy since there are only a handful of devices and cables to consider.
Solid-state Drive 
(SSD)
A storage drive that is the fastest storage option, it has no moving parts, 
doesn't need the power to retain data, and can read, write, and fetch faster 
than any HDD (up to 7000 MB/s, as opposed to 200 MB/s with HDDs). 
SSDs are the new standard for PC storage. They are small, fast, and durable, 
but also expensive, with limited capacity, and they can fail suddenly. SSDs 
are best for activities that require speed, like browsing online or editing large 
files.
Solid-state Hybrid 
Drive (SSHD)
A storage drive that integrates an SSD's speed and an HDD's capacity into a 
single device; It decides what to store in solid-state versus a hard disk based 
on user activity. SSHDs are faster than HDDs, offer better performance, cost 
less than pure SSDs, and have higher capacities than SSDs. Hard and solid-
state hybrid drives are sometimes called spinning drives because they use 
spinning plates to read, write, and fetch data.
Standards 802.11 
a/b/g/n/ac
Older IEEE standards for WLANs evolved to become faster and more 
efficient. 802.11 ac, also known as Wi-Fi 5, was introduced in 2013.
Star Topology 
network
It has a central computer that acts as a hub. Each device connects to the 
central computer with a dedicated cable known as a backbone cable. Star is 
the most common type of topology.
Static IP
A broadband type is common in a business where the IP address does not 
change.
Static IP addresses
IP addresses that are manually assigned. Network servers or devices with 
specific protocol settings often use Static IP addresses.
Storage Area 
Network (SAN)
A network of servers, storage systems, switches, software, and services to 
provide secure, robust data transfers; A SAN storage system involves many 
devices and connections across multiple sites. SANs have better application 
performance, are central and consolidated, are offsite, so data is protected 
and ready for recovery, and include simple, centralized management of 
connections and settings. SANs can span multiple sites, are more expensive, 
harder to manage, appear as a local drive, use fiber, are easily scalable, and 
are fault tolerant.
Storage as a Service 
(STaaS)
Service companies provide by selling network storage space to customers. 
This saves their customers from having to purchase and maintain network 
equipment. STaaS examples include Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, 
Box, and Amazon Drive.
Storage Gateway
A service that connects on-premises devices with cloud storage has three 
types of storage gateways: file, tape, and volume.
Subnet mask
A subnet mask is like an IP address but only for internal network usage. Each 
subnet mask identifies the boundary between the IP network and the IP host. 
Routers use subnet masks to route data packets to the right place.
Subnetting
The process involves taking a large, single network and splitting it into 
individual smaller subnetworks or subnets. Subnetting makes network 
routing much more efficient since it helps traffic travel shorter distances and 
passes through fewer routers.
Switch
A device is similar to a hub, except it keeps a table of MAC addresses. When 
a switch receives data, it looks up the proper MAC address and forwards it to 
the right place. Switches are more efficient than hubs because they only send 
data to the intended recipient. Switches connect to modems. If a switch fails, 
the entire network fails.
Synchronization
A technology that lets you transition from one device to another without 
losing any newly added information. Mobile devices can sync via wired or 
wireless connection.
Tape Gateway
A type of storage gateway that acts as a backup server in the cloud. It uses 
the S3, Glacier, and Glacier Deep Archive protocols to store virtual tape 
backups. Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive protocols enable secure and 
durable cloud-archive storage at a lower cost than other storage solutions. 
Glacier features instant archive retrieval, whereas Glacier Deep Archive 
features 12-to-48-hour data retrieval.
Tethering
A technology that enables a phone's cell network to provide service to 
another device.
TCP/IP suite
A collection of protocols that provide a complete networking solution
Teletype Network 
(telnet)
A protocol that is used to control another device via console or command 
shell remotely. Telnet lets users configure network devices from almost 
anywhere worldwide so long as both devices have network connectivity. 
However, Telnet should not be used because data is in clear text (no 
encryption). The default port for Telnet is 23.
Thunderbolt Cable
Another Apple proprietary cable. It comes as either copper or optical cable. 
The maximum length is 3 meters for copper and 60 meters for optical. It 
provides data and power to peripheral devices, most commonly storage and 
display devices.
Tracert
A diagnostic command prompt utility that traces the route a packet of 
network data takes between its start point and its endpoint.
Transmission 
control protocol 
(TCP)
A protocol that guarantees sent data makes it to its intended recipient. It's 
slower and requires more resources.
Transmission 
Control 
Protocol/Internet 
Protocol Model 
(TCP/IP model)
A set of standards that allow computers to communicate on a network. 
TCP/IP is based on the OSI model and functions similarly. The background 
protocols are still in place, but how they are organized is slightly different. 
The data travels through fewer layers on both ends.
Transmission mode
One of the four ways an IP packet can be transmitted across a network is 
Unicast, Anycast, Multicast, and Broadcast.
Tree Topology 
network
A network that combines the topology characteristics of bus and star 
topology, tree topology is a structure where all the computers are 
hierarchically connected. For example, at a university, where each building 
has its star network, and all the central computers of those star networks are 
linked in a campus-wide system.
Universally 
Administered MAC 
Address (UAA)
Uniquely assigned to a device by its manufacturer.
USB Cables
USB supports two speeds for cables that connect to a wide variety of 
peripheral devices. Low speed supports a data transfer rate of 1.5 Mbps at 
lengths up to 3 meters. Full speed supports data transfer rates of 12 Mbps at 
lengths up to 5 meters. USB cables can carry data and power.
VGA Cables
Cables that connect older analog video graphics adapters to a display
Video Cables
Cables that connect from a specific type of video port on a computer to a 
matching video port on a tv, monitor, projector, or other display. Video cable 
technologies and connection types include VGA, HDMI, Mini-HDMI, 
DisplayPort, and DVI.
Virtual Private 
Network (VPN)
A private network of connected devices is established across a public 
network. VPNs make network traffic unreadable until it reaches its intended 
destination. VPNs also disguise users' online identities. VPNs make it harder 
to track user's online activity and steal data traveling across public networks.
Volume Gateway
A type of storage gateway that uses the Internet Small Computer System 
Interface, or iSCSI, protocol, enables on-premises applications to transfer 
block data to cloud storage over TCP/IP networks. Volume gateways have 
two modes: cached and stored. Stored mode creates S3 backups of all locally 
stored content for recovery purposes. Cached mode is just like stored mode, 
except it only keeps frequently used data on-premises, which requires much 
less infrastructure.
Wide Area Network 
(WAN)
A network that extends over a large geographic area, WANs are often 
established with leased telecommunication circuits.
Wi-Fi
A type of radio signal sent from a wireless router
Wi-Fi 6 (Standard 
802.11 ax)
An IEEE standard for WLANs that provides faster throughput speeds, better 
battery life, and less bandwidth congestion than Wi-Fi 5 technology.
WiMAX
A broadband wireless solution was developed in the early 2000s as an 
alternative to wired DSL or cable, especially in rural areas. WiMAX stands 
for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access.
Wired networking
Wire connections allow users to communicate over a network; most 
computer networks still depend on cables or wires to connect devices and 
transfer data.
Wireless access 
point (WAP)
A device that allows Wi-Fi devices to connect to a wired network. The WAP 
usually connects to a wired router as a standalone device. The WAP can also 
be a central wireless connection point for computers with wireless network 
adapters. The WAP is plugged into a wired network switch. The WAP reads 
each computer's MAC address and forwards that to the wired switch. If the 
wired network is connected to a router with internet access, the wireless 
network will also have internet access. They are also called "AP" or "access 
points."
Wired Equivalent 
Privacy (WEP)
The first security protocol was developed. It was retired due to security 
flaws. It is only in use now when equipment is old or not updated.
Wireless Ad Hoc 
Network (WANET)
It uses Wi-Fi signals from whatever infrastructure happens to be available at 
the time to connect devices instantly, anywhere. WANETs are similar in size 
to WLANs but use technology closer to WWANs and cellular networks. 
Advantages include: flexibility, no required infrastructure, and can be set up 
anywhere instantly. Disadvantages include limited bandwidth quality, not 
being robust, and security risks. There are also "MANETs" or "Mobile ad 
hoc networks" and "VANETs" or "Vehicle ad hoc networks." These are 
similar to WANETs but have different specifications.
Wireless Local Area 
Network (WLAN)
A network that links multiple devices using wireless communication to form 
a LAN. WLAN users can move around within the WLAN area (home or 
office) and remain connected to the network. A gateway can be added to a 
WLAN to provide access to the Internet. WLANs use Wi-Fi signals from 
routers, modems, and wireless access points to wirelessly connect devices. 
Wi-Fi follows the IEEE 802.11 wireless standard. The latest version of IEEE 
802.11ax enables 8K video streaming, data-heavy cloud computing, and 
virtual reality experiences. Advantages include reliability, versatility, high 
data transmission rates, and easy management. Disadvantages include low 
network coverage area, the number of devices affecting speed, and less 
security.
Wireless 
Metropolitan Area 
Networks (WMAN)
A network that spans a geographic area serves ranges greater than 100 
meters. Connects several wireless LANs, Generally used to cover an entire 
city. WMAN is used for fixed wireless between the Internet and homes & 
businesses.
Wireless network
A network that lets users connect without cables. An alternative to traditional 
cable and fiber optic networks. Wireless networks have become crucial for 
enabling mobility. Wireless networks like WPAN, WLAN, WMAN, and 
WWAN use radio waves instead of wires for data transmission and 
reception.
Wireless network 
types
The four main types of wireless networks are WPAN, WLAN, WMAN, and 
WWAN.
Wireless 
networking
When people communicate and access applications and information without 
being physically plugged in.
Wireless Personal 
Area Network 
(WPAN)
Interconnects devices in a short span, generally within a person's reach 
(around 10 meters); it connects devices within a person's range (around 10 
meters). WPANs use signals like Infrared, Zigbee, Bluetooth, and ultra-
wideband to connect to peripheral devices. WPAN uses the IEEE 802.15 
wireless standard. Bluetooth and Zigbee are some of the IEEE 802.15 signals 
that wirelessly connect devices over short distances. Advantages include 
flexibility and efficiency, one-time easy setup, and portability. Disadvantages 
include limited range, limited data rates, and more expensive.
Wi-Fi Protected 
Access (WPA)
Stronger than WEP and supports a wide variety of devices.
Wi-Fi Protected 
Access 2 (WPA2)
It is supported on newer wireless devices. WPA2 is the most common and 
most secure. When you configure your encryption, select the WPA2 security 
mode. Then set your "Pre-Shared Key." This is your WPA password. It must 
be 8 to 63 characters long. Choose a longer, harder-to-guess key for stronger 
security.
Wireless Wide Area 
Network (WWAN)
It covers large areas such as neighboring towns and cities. WWAN is used 
for mobile access to the Internet from outdoor areas. It provides regional, 
nationwide, and global wireless coverage. This includes private networks of 
multinational corporations, the Internet, cellular networks like 4G, 5G, Long-
Term Evolution (or LTE), and LoRaWAN (which is a low-power WAN 
protocol built on top of the techniques used in long-range radio-
modulation). Advantages include global wireless coverage, better security 
than WLAN, and centralized flexible infrastructure (like cloud apps and 
storage). Disadvantages include: expensive, difficult to maintain, and 
decreased coverage over large areas.
Worldwide 
Interoperability for 
Microwave Access 
(WiMAX)
The family of wireless communication standards provides WMAN 
broadband connectivity. Similar open-source and proprietary broadband 
technologies exist, but WiMAX is the accepted suite of standards based on 
IEEE 802.16. Advantages include: covering multiple city locations, being 
easy to use, extending and exchanging, and being managed by an ISP, 
government entity, or corporation. Disadvantages include requiring special 
user permissions, being less secure, and being slower than wired.
Workgroup, or 
Homegroup
A group of computers on a small office/home office (SOHO) network, 
typically without a server, Data is stored on the user device that created it. To 
share files and folders, users set them to 'public.' The added points of failure 
(scattered data on multiple devices) create a higher risk of data loss. Newer 
cloud solutions provide the same features more securely. Workgroups and 
homegroups are less common. Homegroups have been removed from 
Microsoft Windows 10 altogether.

Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability

Welcome to "Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability"
After watching this video, you will be able to
explain what the CIA Triad is,
list concerns related to the CIA Triad, and
define common regulatory standards and penalties.
A comprehensive security program must contain confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
These are known as the CIA Triad.
Confidentiality means that data is protected from unauthorized access.
Integrity means that data is protected from unauthorized changes.
And, availability means that you have access to your data whenever you need it.
When confidential data is exposed beyond the intended audience, it causes risk.
Confidential information is kept secret to prevent identity theft, compromised accounts and systems,
legal concerns, damage to reputation, and other severe consequences.
To determine if data should be confidential, ask:
Who is authorized?
Do confidentiality regulations apply?
Are there conditions for when data can be accessed?
What would the impact of disclosure be?
Is the data valuable?
Cybercriminals are always after sensitive information or personal data.
To keep confidential data secure, control data access and use security tools like encryption
and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Data is one of the most valuable assets a company can have, but it is not static.
It can be transferred to other systems, altered, and updated multiple times.
Data integrity guarantees that data is accurate, complete, and consistent.
It covers data in storage, during processing, and in transit.
Without data integrity, loss, corruption, or compromise can cause significant damage
and financial loss for both businesses and customers.
The two main types of data integrity are physical and logical.
Physical data integrity is the collection of actions and fail safes that protect the
physical systems that store and process the data.
Logical data integrity are the checks and protocols that protect data from human error
and hackers.
These confirm that data is correct and accurate as it's used in different ways within an
organization.
Unauthorized information alteration threatens the integrity of any process or outcome based
on that information, including:
financial records,
vote totals,
health records,
news stories,
and more.
Tools that fight unauthorized information alteration include:
File integrity monitoring (or FIM), which audits sensitive files and folders to ensure all activity is 
authorized.
And relational database management systems (or RDBMSs).
An RDBMS is a database that records user access and data changes. RDBMS is safer than a 
spreadsheet program.
To preserve data integrity, security plans must:
Prevent unauthorized user access,
Prevent unauthorized data changes by authorized users,
And use error checking and data validation.
Data availability means that authorized users have immediate and reliable access to their
data.
This includes granting access to authorized users with passwords and security questions.
Some of the most fundamental threats to availability are non-malicious, including hardware failures,
unscheduled software downtime, and network bandwidth issues.
Malicious attacks against availability include various forms of sabotage intended to cause
harm to an organization by denying users access to the information system.
One such example would be a DoS (or Denial of Service) attack where a website or server
is targeted with so much traffic that it overwhelms that system, degrading performance until the
server is unable to respond.
To protect against these threats, systems that require high availability, (99.999% uptime)
have network monitoring, redundant hardware, and backup servers ready to take over.
If the primary system is compromised, business continuity and customer access can be maintained.
There are regulatory standards, contracts, and local laws that companies and organizations
must follow to secure and maintain data.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, Regulates the use and 
disclosure of protected health information in America.
And the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, regulates digital privacy for all
countries in the European Union.
Fines and penalties for non-compliance help companies keep data safe, secure, accurate, and 
private.
In this video, you learned that:
The CIA Triad is Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
Breaches and data loss can result in financial losses for both consumers and companies.
To preserve data integrity, security plans must prevent unauthorized access and changes.
Regulations like HIPAA and GDPR help to keep data safe, secure, accurate, and private.
Non-compliance or repeated violations of privacy regulations can result in hefty fines and
penalties.

Reading: Intellectual Property and Types of 
Confidential Information

An information asset is information or data that is of value. Examples include patient records, 
customer information, and intellectual property. Information assets can exist physically, on paper, 
disks, in other media, or electronically in databases and files.
•	Data analytics is when raw data, like values or facts, create meaningful information. Data is 
the raw values and facts, usually collected by automated systems. For example, page visits, 
link clicks, and monthly sales.
•	Information is a summary of the raw data. For example, positive or negative results that 
happen after some specific change.
•	Insights are conclusions based on the results of information analysis. Meaningful business 
decisions are based on insights. For example, if a positive trend occurs after a manager 
changes store hours, the correct business decision would be to maintain those new hours.
•	Intellectual property (or IP) refers to creations of the mind and generally are not tangible. 
Copyright, trademark, and patent law often protect IP. Some IP examples are industrial 
designs, trade secrets, and research discoveries. Even some employee knowledge is 
considered intellectual property. Companies use a legally binding document called a Non-
Disclosure Agreement (or an NDA) to prevent sharing of sensitive information.
Digital Products
Digital products are non-tangible assets a company owns. Examples include software, online music, 
online courses, e-Books or audiobooks, and web elements like WordPress or Shopify themes. A 
company must protect digital products from piracy and reverse engineering. Source codes, licenses, 
and activation keys also need protection from hackers and insider threats.
•	Digital Rights Management, or DRM, is code added directly to files that helps prevent 
digital assets from being copied or pirated, but some tools can remove DRM code.
•	The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, makes it illegal to bypass copy 
protections or to develop technology that helps bypass copy protections.
Data-driven business decisions help companies respond to real events. For example, sales and 
marketing data helps identify trends and customer interests. And production and fulfillment data 
help identify productivity issues in manufacturing, billing systems, transportation, and more. 
Getting the correct information is key to data-driven business decisions.
•	Data capture is the collection of data from multiple sources and storing the secure storage of 
it securely in relational databases or, more commonly, semi-structured data warehouses. 
Data may be captured by: Server logs showing where customers browse, IoT sensors in 
home appliances and business technology, customer and employee surveys, or rating 
systems.
•	Data correlation is when raw data points are analyzed to find connections or links. For 
example, Netflix uses tools that compare searches, views, and ratings to predict which 
movies and shows will be successful on their platform. AI and machine learning algorithms 
automate parts of the analysis.
•	Meaningful reporting is the presentation of analyzed information in ways that help people 
further analyze and interpret. Reporting tools use captured and correlated data to provide 
charts, keyword searches, and graphs that help companies achieve business insights.
Confidential Information
Confidential information is information that employees must keep secret. Employees are trained to 
recognize and deal with confidential information so that it remains secure. Companies rank 
information and files by how sensitive each one is. Each company ranks its information differently, 
but there are four main types of confidential information that should be universally protected:
•	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is any information that can be used to identify 
someone, like government ID numbers, birthdates, addresses, and phone numbers.
•	Company Confidential information is any information used to run a company, like 
intellectual property, product designs, procedures, plans, employee records, and financial 
data.
•	Customer Confidential Information is information customers or partners provide to 
companies, which includes PII and things like purchase histories and credit card 
information.
•	Protected Health Information (PHI) is any information added to a person's medical record 
during diagnosis or treatment that can be used to identify them, like PII, medical history, 
prescription lists, photos, and more. Examples of careless data handling include entering a 
customer's credit card information into an unencrypted database, leaving a patient's medical 
file unattended at the front desk, or letting a work friend borrow your password to download 
files because they forgot theirs.
Some examples of properly handling confidentiality include:
•	Restricting access to only those who need the information
•	Not allowing unauthorized views or copies to be created
•	Storing information securely with encryption, firewalls, permissions, and more
•	Destroying any file copies that are no longer needed-not just discarding them
•	Getting explicit consent before processing or storing information, including disclosure about 
how long the company will keep it
•	Ensuring employees create strong passwords that they do not write down or share and that 
they change those passwords regularly.
PII, PCI, and SPI
PII is sometimes confused with PCI and SPI because they're very similar. In most non-legal 
situations, these terms are often used interchangeably. Here are the differences between them.
•	Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that identifies a person.
•	Personal Customer Information (PCI) identifies and describes a customer. It includes many 
of the same data types as PII, like name, address, contact information, account login, and 
demographics. It can also include descriptive data like age, gender, job title, and marital 
status.
•	Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) is information that does not identify but can cause 
harm if made public.

Threats and Breaches

Welcome to "Threats and Breaches."
After watching this video, you will be able to identify the different types of security threats, list 
examples of security threats, and explain the difference between a worm and a trojan.
Weak security policies can lead to physical threats, tampering, or the theft of hardware.
Only trusted, authorized personnel should have physical access to information systems
and only for the specific systems they are responsible for.
It's much easier to steal data directly from a laptop or server than it is to remotely
hack into a complex network.
To keep hardware safe from physical threats, tampering, and theft, lock it in a secured
area with card readers on doors to limit access.
Use robust surveillance on the inside and outside of the premises, and keep these maintained,
updated, and tested.
Hardware failure or destruction can occur during power outages, fires, and natural disasters
like earthquakes, floods, tornados, hurricanes, and electrical storms.
Environmental conditions such as humidity, and mold also pose risks.
Keep hardware safe with a well-maintained infrastructure that includes
fire suppression systems, backup power, and a properly functioning HVAC system to prevent
humidity and mold.
Ultimately, none of these strategies will work without a detailed plan for what to do if disaster 
strikes or a system is breached.
Regular planning, maintenance, and backups, as well as run-throughs of mock disaster and
attack scenarios will help refine the process and identify security weaknesses.
Unpatched systems, misconfigured firewalls, weak cybersecurity, and weak physical security
are just a few ways that data threats occur.
Data leaks are the accidental exposure of confidential or sensitive data through a security
vulnerability.
Data breaches are when a data leak is caused intentionally by a cybercriminals.
These occur when social engineering or phishing attacks trick employees into leaking sensitive
credentials or information.
Data dumps are when cybercriminals dump stolen data onto the dark web for monetary gain.
A data dump might include PII, PHI, bank account numbers, PINs, social security numbers, and
more.
Other cybercriminals buy and use data dumps for things like identity theft and password
attacks.
Dumpster diving is the act of physically searching through a literal dumpster to find something
valuable.
A company's trash might contain lists of customer names, phone numbers, contact information,
business plans, product designs, or an access code written on a post-it note.
Tech companies require document shredding and device destruction as a normal part of
business because these can be stolen from the trash to harvest data that can be used
for identity theft and data breaches.
Or the data could be sold to hackers, or a company's competitors.
Insider threats are threats that come from within an organization.
An employee is an insider threat if they sell valuable or sensitive information, hurt or embarrass the 
company, or give away valuable credentials or data accidentally.
Insider threats can also be caused by hackers who recruit insiders by blackmailing employees
or promising money or some other reward.
Software threats include theft, exploits, and malware.
Software or license theft is the unauthorized copy or use of copyright-protected software.
This includes pirating software and counterfeiting activation codes.
Exploits are pieces of code that use vulnerabilities in hardware or software to get into a system.
Malware-infected websites use exploits to automatically download malware to a system.
This is called a drive-by download.
Malware is a general term for software designed to compromise computer systems.
Malware can cause system slowdowns, odd requests, browser misdirection, and popup ads.
It can also steal data, record everything you do with or near your device, spam your
contacts with infected links,
and connect your computer to a network of hijacked computers that are remotely controlled
(known as a botnet).
Malware can come from attachments, sketchy websites, file downloads, infected USB drives,
or links in emails, ads, social media, torrents, and even text messages.
Phishing and Remote Desktop Protocol attacks (or RDP attacks) are the most popular attack
vectors for ransomware since they result in a higher success rate.
To avoid malware, keep software updated, don't open strange attachments or links, back up
your data, use strong antivirus software, and use strong, frequently updated passwords.
Malware types include viruses, worms, trojans, exploits, spyware, adware, and ransomware.
Computer viruses are programs designed to spread from host to host, just like real viruses.
An infected app or file has to be started by a user for a virus to activate.
Viruses can turn on a webcam, record keystrokes and site visits, steal data, corrupt files,
and hijack email accounts.
Let's look at some different types:
Program viruses are bits of code that insert themselves into another program.
Macro viruses affect Microsoft Office files via the macros they use to automate tasks.
Stealth viruses copy themselves to different locations to avoid antivirus scans.
Polymorphic viruses change their characteristics to get around cybersecurity defences.
97% of all malware uses polymorphic viruses.
Worms are viruses that start themselves after identifying system weaknesses.
They don't rely on apps or files.
Unlike viruses, worms can be controlled remotely.
Trojans trick you into installing legitimate-seeming software that includes harmful malware.
Spyware collects personal data, login credentials, credit card information, online activity,
and can record using a device's camera or microphone.
Adware is software coded into online ads that records your personal data, website visits,
and keystrokes to send you personalized ads.
Both adware and spyware can be legitimate or malicious.
Ransomware locks a system, encrypts its files, and displays a ransom demand.
To get the encryption key you must pay the ransom.
Or you can regain access by doing a full system restore from a backup.
In this video, you learned that hardware must be kept safe from physical damage, tampering, and 
theft.
Hardware is vulnerable to natural disasters, fires, mold, and power outages.
Insider threats can be an employee or a hacker looking to recruit an insider Software threats include 
theft, exploits, and malware.
Malware includes viruses, spyware, adware, and ransomware 97% of all malware includes 
polymorphic viruses.


Phishing, Social Engineering, and Other Attacks

Welcome to "Phishing, Social, Engineering, and Other Attacks."
After watching this video, you will be able to
list the three types of impersonation attacks,
recognize social engineering attacks,
and demonstrate how to minimize exposure to shoulder surfing, pretexting, and phishing.
Impersonation is when someone pretends to be something they are not.
A common type of impersonation attack is when a hacker sets up a public wifi network that
seems legitimate.
This is also known as an "Evil Twin".
Once a user connects, the hacker can intercept the user's login credentials, session information,
and PII.
Another type of impersonation is when a hacker sets up a fake website that looks and feels
exactly like a real website.
And a third type of impersonation attack is when a hacker pretends to be someone else to steal
data or take over systems.
This is also called social engineering.
Now, impersonation attacks can be used individually or in combination with each other.
For example, a hacker may pretend to be a bank that sends you an email or text with
links to a fake website.
They are trying to trick you so they can steal your credentials to the real site and install
malware on your device.
Internet-based cybercrime and online attacks evolved from much older "confidence tricks"
or "cons" that have been around for thousands of years.
Today, cons are also called "social engineering".
Here we will find out more about social engineering and cover some additional online attack types.
Now, social engineering is when an attacker uses social situations to obtain sensitive information.
Attackers often use psychological manipulation to gain a person's trust to trick them.
They often use a sense of fear or urgency to make people act quickly.
Social engineering relies on human error, while cyberattacks rely on malware or vulnerabilities.
Social engineering can include shoulder surfing, baiting, pretexting, and phishing.
It is estimated that social engineering plays a part in around 90% of all security breaches.
Shoulder-surfing attacks occur in places like cafes, hotel lobbies, airports, and libraries.
Hackers come to these places and sit strategically where they can watch your screen and keyboard
to see usernames, passwords, PINs, and more.
If you leave your device unattended, someone can even physically install malware on your
device with a USB stick.
This can also be done digitally if you connect to public wifi that has been infected with
malware.
So, when using your devices in public:
Never use public wifi,
Never leave your devices unattended,
And always obscure the view of anyone watching by using privacy screens or moving away from
others.
In social engineering, baiting is the use of a lure.
A physical lure is an object used to trick people into infecting their own system.
For example, a USB stick left in a public place.
Any person might pick it up and insert it in their device.
A logical lure is software used to trick people into infecting their own system.
For example, an online ad or the promise of something for free.
In both cases, by inserting the device or clicking on a link, the victim can unknowingly
infect their own system and give the attacker full control.
Pretexting is when an attacker pretends to be someone with authority.
Attackers may pretend to be a co-worker who needs certain phone numbers, addresses, or
security codes.
Or they may pretend to be an account manager at your bank who needs your password.
Pretext attacks use fear, intimidation, or sympathy to pressure you into revealing sensitive
data.
They want you to act quickly, without thinking.
Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends emails or texts to create
a sense of urgency or pressure.
For example, your bank sends a text saying your checking account was compromised, and
they need you to click a link to reset your username and password.
The link then takes you to your bank's website and you reset your credentials.
But you didn't notice that the text and website were fake, and your password was never
reset.
Now the attacker can log into your account and transfer all your funds.
So, within phishing, there is also:
Spear phishing, which targets a specific individual.
Whaling, which targets high-level executives.
And vishing, which targets people over the phone with fraud and scams.
All phishing attacks involve tricking people to reveal sensitive data or complete a task
that results in a security breach or identity theft.
Information obtained from social engineering can be used to steal a person's identity.
Thousands of people fall victim to identity theft and identity fraud each year.
Identity theft is the act of stealing personal, private, or financial information from a person
with the intent of using it to commit fraud.
Identity fraud is the act of using the personal, private, or financial information stolen from
victims to commit fraud.
Criminals use stolen identities to apply for credit cards, open bank accounts, or take
out loans.
To avoid identity theft, keep your personal information secure, use strong passwords,
and regularly monitor your financial accounts.
In this video, you learned that
impersonation attacks include public Wi-Fi traps, fake sites, and social engineering,
shoulder Surfing is physically spying on others to collect data,
baiting is the use of a lure,
pretexting is pretending to be someone with authority.
Phishing is sending emails or texts to create a sense of urgency or pressure.
Social engineers can use the data they steal for identity fraud,
and identity thieves often steal the identities of children or deceased people.

Password Management Techniques 

Welcome to "Password Management Techniques."
After watching this video, you will be able to
explore password management best practices,
identify strong and weak passwords,
and create a basic set of password policies for improved security.
Password cracking is getting a correct password in an unauthorized way.
Brute force attacks submit as many passwords as possible hoping one will work.
Dictionary attacks use words pulled from dictionaries or newspapers to crack passwords,
and rainbow attacks use words from an original password hash
to generate all other possible passwords.
Hashing is when an algorithm transforms an input string (like your password) into a smaller, fixed-
length output string (or hash) that's saved to a file.
A hash is like a digital fingerprint.
Passwords are hashed with a scrambling algorithm.
If a password hash is determined, attackers can use it to determine other passwords that were 
scrambled in the same way - that can be over 90% of unknown passwords in some cases.
Strong passwords and an effective password strategy are essential to online security.
People tend to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.
But weak or stolen passwords account for more than 80% of company data breaches.
Each online account should have a unique password, especially corporate accounts.
And employee training should exist to explain why password management and data security is so 
important.
A password policy is a set of rules that provide guidance on using strong passwords.
Password policies should require:
A minimum length of 12 characters.
A mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.
A unique password for each account or device, including personal devices used for work.
A mandatory password change every 6 to 12 months.
Employee training on cyberattacks.
Notification to employees that the company will never ask for passwords.
Password policies should insist that employees should:
Never reuse or recycle passwords.
Never share passwords, not even with the CEO.
Never write passwords down.
Never store passwords in a digital file.
Hackers can guess one trillion passwords per second.
Passwords often have quotes from movies, songs, or books.
But hackers already have online databases full of these quotes,
and lists of dictionary words, encyclopedia entries, and more.
For stronger security
use 12-characters, minimum.
Avoid names, places, dictionary words, or PII.
Use upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and special characters.
Avoid using "leet" or symbols for letters (hackers already know about it).
For example, writing the word 'password' using the number four instead of the letter 'A',
or the dollar sign instead of the letter 'S'.
Use random characters.
and use a passphrase (12 or more random words).
Here what strong passwords look like:
Organizations should never ask customers or employees for their passwords.
When employees know that their company would never ask for passwords, they are less likely to 
fall for impersonation and phishing attacks.
Don't share your password with anyone.
Not even your boss or the IT department. IT staff have admin rights.
Any work they do can be done with their own logins.
Companies must teach employees the risks of password reuse and take steps to stop it.
Password reuse means using the same username and password for all your accounts, using common 
passwords like '12345' or the word 'password', and using the same password but with a different 
username.
Hackers can easily link previously used passwords to people and they can 'spray' common 
passwords at online accounts.
Password expiration is when a password is set to expire after a specific amount of time.
In the past, employees typically had to change their passwords every 90 days.
But this inspired weak and reused passwords.
Longer intervals help employees use less risky behavior.
Password expiration does make sense but not once it starts to negatively affect security.
In this video, you learned that:
A hash is a smaller saved code used to store scrambled passwords Hackers use password cracking to 
gain unauthorized access to other people's passwords.
Strong passwords are long, random, secret, and never reused.
A company or employer will never ask for your password.

Security Threats: Access Control, Authorization, 
and Authentication

Welcome to "Security Threats: Access Control, Authorization, and Authentication."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define each authentication factor, explain how digital accounting is used, and identify the four 
methods of non-repudiation.
There are three processes involved in logging in to a network or account.
Access Control - limiting or granting access to different areas based on user status.
Authorization - giving permission to access a computer, network, app, or account.
Authentication - proving it's you with a password or other credentials.
Access control prevents unauthorized viewing, modification, or copying of data.
IT staff use access control to restrict what users can do, which resources they have access to, and 
what functions they are allowed to perform.
Access is granted using the rule of least privilege where access is only granted to resources that a 
user needs to fulfil their role.
Role-based access control (or RBAC) follows a company's org chart.
Different customer and employee roles are set up as groups on a network, and then those groups are 
granted certain permissions.
When a new user joins the network, they are assigned to the group that fits their role.
They will have the lowest level of permissions they need to do their job.
Authorization is when you have permission to access a location or do an action.
Before you can access an account or system, you need authorization.
Access control must be set up before any authorization is granted to maintain data security.
And authorization must be set up for your user account before you're able to log in.
Once you are authorized, you can then use authentication to log in.
Authentication is the act of confirming the identity of a user.
Authentication involves two steps: entering the correct login information and confirming that it is 
really you.
Authentication factors used to confirm identity include:
Something you know (like a username, password, PIN, or answers to security questions),
Something you have (like a mobile device, security key, or security badge), And something you are 
(biometrics like facial recognition or a fingerprint, iris, or voice scan).
Authentication methods include single-factor (or SFA), two-factor (or 2FA), muti-factor (or MFA), 
and single sign-on (or SSO).
SSO lets you log in to multiple applications and platforms with one login.
2FA and MFA are the most secure ways to log in because they require at least two authentication 
factors.
Access control sets boundaries, authorization gives access, and authentication confirms identity.
In the Security field, it's important to know the right balance between the three A's:
Strictly applying role-based permissions groups won't secure data if those groups all have the same 
authorization levels.
The same is true if groups have properly set permissions, but are not properly applied by 
administrators.
Using strong passwords and MFA won't secure data if all groups have the same permissions.
The same problem exists if groups have properly set permissions, but passwords are weak.
Using strong passwords and MFA won't secure data if all users are assigned to the same group.
The same problem exists if administrators assign users to the proper groups, but passwords are 
weak.
Best practice should require strong authentication, strong authorization, and strong access control.
Digital accounting is used in troubleshooting, security analysis, forensics, and hacking.
Logs: Most software and systems generate audit logs. Audit logs capture log file events which can 
show who did what and how the system behaved.
Tracking: Websites can track your OS, browser version, installed extensions, screen resolution,
installed fonts, time zone, language, and how long you spent on a site and what you did there.
Cookies: A cookie is code used to track, personalize, and save information about your browsing 
session.
Cookies can also be used to ban you from a website if you've violated any of its conditions for use.
Browsing history: is a list of recently visited websites.
Anyone with access to your device can see what sites you visited.
Attackers use browsing history to learn where they might impersonate their victims, and companies 
use it to see which sites you go to on your work computer.
Non-repudiation is when you can't deny being in a specific location.
It guarantees that a message sent between two parties is genuine.
Like a digital signature.
It includes:
Video: Clear recordings of a person entering, leaving, or occupying a space
Biometrics: fingerprint or iris scans can confirm whether a person physically accessed a device, 
network, or area.
Signature: When a signature is used in conjunction with a hardware token, it becomes a digital 
signature. This authenticates the signer.
Receipt: A digital receipt proves that a message was sent from one party to another.
In this video, you learned that:
Role-based access control (RBAC) uses network groups with different permissions levels.
The methods of authentication are single-factor, two-factor, and multi-factor.
Authentication factors are something you know, something you have, something you are, and 
somewhere you are.
Logs, tracking, cookies, and browsing history are used to troubleshoot and to uncover user activity 
on devices, and non-repudiation uses video, biometrics, signature, and receipt.

Authentication and SSO

Welcome to "Authentication and SSO."
After watching this video, you will be able to explore the differences between SFA, 2FA, and MFA, 
list the three main types of identification factors, explain how MFA reduces risk of breach.
Single factor authentication (or SFA) is when you enter one credential to log in.
Username and password is the most common form.
Single-factor authentication is not safe from:
keystroke loggers - malware that captures everything typed on a device,
phishing,
or data breach information sold on the dark web.
With single-factor authentication, anyone who has your username and password can do
whatever they want to with your account or data.
Two-factor authentication (or 2FA) is when you enter two credentials to log in.
Two-factor authentication is usually hardware-based, with the most common form being a security 
key that plugs into a USB port.
2FA devices are the best defense you can have
against phishing and hijacking and are very easy to set up.
Newer versions use NFC so the key only has to be near the device instead of plugged in.
Multifactor authentication, or MFA, is quickly becoming the industry standard for effective security.
It's an extra layer of protection that companies and organizations are using to keep cybercriminals 
out of their systems.
When you're trying to access a resource or device that's using MFA, you need to provide more than 
just the correct password to get in.
MFA offers the following extra protection over SFA:
Risk of a breach occurring is significantly reduced.
MFA factors can't be captured by keystroke loggers.
You're in full control over which factors you provide (phone, email,
text, security questions or some combination of all of them).
Significantly reduced risk from phishing.
It's important to understand that multi-factor authentication is not 100% fail-proof.
As hackers realize that the number of organizations using MFA is steadily on
the rise, they continue to look for ways to circumvent it or to exploit
the vulnerabilities which inevitably exist in these types of solutions.
Identification factors are pieces of information that only you and an authentication service know.
They are:
Something you know -
like your password or PIN,
answers to security questions, or one time password (or OTP) code.
Something you have -
like a phone or email to receive OTP codes, a phone app that can generate OTP codes,
or a device plugged into your phone or computer
Something about you -
Like your fingerprints, retinas, face, or voice
Biometric scans use these to authenticate you online or unlock a door to a secured area.
Single sign-on (or SSO) verifies users for connected accounts or apps so they only have to log in 
once.
Businesses use SSO to simplify and speed up access to resources.
IT departments set up single sign on with vendors like Office365 or Salesforce.com so employees 
are automatically logged in when they sign into their work networks.
This lets employees continue working without having to remember multiple passwords.
In this video, you learned that:
Single-factor authentication is not safe from keystroke loggers, phishing, or data breaches.
2FA is when a physical device must be plugged in before log in.
MFA is when multiple authentication methods are used to log in.
An identification factor is information that only you and an authentication service know.
SSO verifies a user across connected accounts.

Firewalls
A firewall is one of the most effective methods for securing your network from external threats. In a 
non-technical setting, a firewall is a physical, fire-resistant wall designed to keep a fire from 
spreading from one area to the next. Similarly, a computer security firewall is a software program or 
a hardware device designed to keep malicious threats from spreading from the public network to a 
private network or device. Firewalls provide defense against spyware, virus attacks, and hacking. 
They can also help to ensure that sensitive information is kept private.
Types of Firewalls
Software, or host-based firewalls are programs that users install on a computer. Most modern 
operating systems have built-in firewall software. Microsoft, for example, provides Windows 
Defender Firewall. These built-in firewalls help to monitor port traffic and traffic between 
applications.
Hardware, or network-based firewalls users deploy between a network and an Internet gateway. In 
home or small business settings, a router often has built-in firewall protection to stop unwanted 
traffic from the outside. Larger organizations use separate firewall devices to protect their network.
How Firewalls Work
A firewall works by monitoring all incoming and outgoing network traffic. The firewall decides 
whether to permit or deny the traffic based on a predefined set of rules. Firewalls can monitor and 
filter traffic using several different methods.
Packets are small pieces of data that travel across a network. A firewall that uses packet filtering 
reviews each packet that tries to access a network or device. Any packets that match known threats 
or have been explicitly denied are removed and all other packets are sent to their destination.
Stateful inspection, also known as dynamic filtering, monitors the state of active network 
connections. It relies on patterns to analyze and monitor traffic for potential threats.
A proxy firewall is a go-between for the requesting system and the internet. Information is first sent 
to the proxy service before it is forwarded to its destination.
Filters
Firewalls can be configured to meet the specific need of an individual or organization. Traffic can 
be approved or denied based on IP addresses, ports, domain names, and specific words and phrases.
Before you configure your firewall, it is important to create a plan. In many cases, it's best to deny 
all traffic except what is allowed. Rules that are too strict can limit important user functionality. 
However, too loose rules can put your network at risk, so it's usually easier to add approved access 
than it is to recover from a breach that happened because of loose firewall rules. The more rules 
there are, the longer the firewall takes to review the traffic, so you'll want to try to keep a lean but 
efficient set of rules.

Lesson Summary: Common Security Threats and 
Security Best Practices
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	The confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad concerns data protection from 
unauthorized access and unauthorized changes. It also allows you to have access to your 
data when you need it.
•	Intellectual property (IP) refers to creations of the mind that are generally not tangible. It's 
often protected by copyright, trademark, and patent law. Industrial designs, trade secrets, and 
research discoveries are all examples of IP.
•	A worm is a virus that starts itself after identifying system weaknesses. They don't rely on 
apps or files and can be controlled remotely, whereas a trojan tricks you into installing 
legitimate-seeming software that includes harmful malware.
•	Shoulder surfing occurs when hackers observe you in public places to obtain credentials. 
Pretexting is when someone pretends to be someone with authority to gain access to 
sensitive information. Phishing is when an attacker sends emails or texts to create a sense of 
urgency or pressure.
•	A secure password is long, random, secret, and never reused.
•	Compare and contrast, single-factor authentication (SFA) requires one credential to log in, 
such as a password. Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires two credentials and is usually 
hardware-related. Multifactor authentication (MFA) factors can't be captured by keystroke 
loggers and put you in full control over which factors you provide, such as phone, email, 
text, security questions, or some combination of all of them.
•	Firewalls are one of the most effective methods for securing a network from external threats 
by using a software program or hardware device to monitor all incoming and outgoing 
network traffic. The firewall decides whether to permit or deny the traffic based on a 
predefined set of rules.


Safe Browsing Practices: Application Ecosystem 
Security

Welcome to "Safe Browsing Practices: Application Ecosystem Security."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
identify app and software security concerns,
explain how apps and software are compromised, and
list the types of data hackers look for.
Mobile apps are designed to be functional and easy to use.
But they are not always the most secure.
Weak passwords, malware, or poorly designed apps can compromise a device, letting hackers 
access texts, contact lists, personal and business files, and other valuable information.
For better security, use strong passwords, only install app store approved apps, and use multi-factor 
authentication.
Multi-factor authentication, or MFA, is a setting that requires you to fill in a code sent to your email 
or phone to prove that a login attempt came from you.
Strong passwords are long, difficult to guess, and have a mix of numbers, letters, symbols, and 
capitalizations.
For example, the phrase, "Johnny Appleseed loves apples" would be a very strong password,
especially if it included a mix of numbers and symbols.
Some users remove device restrictions so they can make changes and install non-approved
apps.
This is called "rooting" on Android phones and "jailbreaking" on Apple phones.
This adds functionality, but also adds vulnerability.
It is harder to root or jailbreak newer model phones, and there is less reason for it with
updated features and app selections.
To ensure a basic level of security, Apple and Google restrict certain device activities and remove 
apps from their app stores if they don't meet security standards.
Desktop software can be used to open any file stored locally or in the cloud.
Cybercriminals can access and take over software, files, data, and online accounts via PCs that 
don't have strong passwords, PCs left in unsecured physical locations, and via unsecured browsing 
sessions on non-HTTPS websites.
IT departments push out security patches and updates on a regular basis to keep operating
system and app software secure against known vulnerabilities.
But patches and updates alone aren't enough.
Here are some steps you can take to be more secure:
use strong passwords, store PCs in a physically secure location, and lock them when not in use.
Use good antivirus/anti-malware and VPN software and enable automatic updates.
And only browse HTTPS websites and keep software properly configured and updated.
These habits make devices harder to hack, which keeps your data protected as cybercriminals
will simply move on to easier targets.
Business software automates transactions, mines sales data, manages resource and supply
chain information, and more.
Hackers target businesses with ransomware, zero-day attacks, or other cyberattacks to
steal sensitive data, so they can sell or exploit it.
This can cost millions and be devastating to consumers, businesses, organizations, and
governments.
In today's remote-work world, businesses maintain employee education to ensure security best
practices are followed,
and they use strong tools to prevent, detect and respond to vulnerabilities and threats.
To protect corporate files, systems, and resources, businesses must limit access.
The ability to share files within an organization or business-to-business is important.
When email or USB drives aren't an option, organizations may choose internal network
sharing on company-owned hardware for sharing, storage, and collaboration.
Or they may turn to the cloud for a solution, like the enterprise versions of Box, OneDrive,
or Google Drive.
Whichever solution is used, employees must be taught how to properly secure corporate
data.
A careless worker who clicks on a phishing email or fails to abide by corporate policy
can expose a company to unnecessary risk.
Company data should only be shared on a need-to-know basis.
Insider theft of data and intellectual property is common.
Strict access control helps avoid it.
But filesharing should be practical.
If a company makes it too difficult, employees will find a way around it.
For example, consumer-level cloud storage and sharing freeware.
Security isn't as robust in those solutions.
If there's a breach, hackers can steal passwords and reuse them to gain access to company
networks.
It's important to remember that you're only as secure as your weakest link.
That's why there are so many ways to configure network sharing.
Whether it's on-premises, in the cloud, or stored in an unauthorized freeware account,
having a plan ahead of time to deal with these potential situations will help companies
avoid the worst.
In this video, you learned:
Strong passwords, antivirus/malware software, VPN, and updates are used to secure apps and
devices.
Hackers target apps to mine for sensitive data, intellectual property, trade secrets,
and financial data.
Businesses use multi-factor authentication to protect data, information, and consumer
trust,
and multiple layers of security are required to keep devices and their data secure.

Safe Browsing Practices: Public Browsing Risks


Welcome to "Safe Browsing Practices: Public Browsing Risks."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
List the security concerns of public browsing,
identify public browsing risks,
and list the types of data hackers steal from public networks.
Free and open networks are available in many places.
Airports, coffee shops, hotels, and even fast-food restaurants will offer their guests access
to public wifi.
These networks are not encrypted.
Your device may warn you about this when you're trying to connect to one of them.
Unsecure networks invite eavesdroppers to view everything you send and receive on that
network.
They can potentially install malware on your device or hijack your session if your device
is not protected.
Public connections are free to use but that doesn't mean there isn't a cost involved.
The provider might track everything you do on the Wi-Fi connection then sell your data
to advertisers or other interested parties.
If a hacker gets access to your device via public wifi, they have free rein over everything
on it and can even obtain the credentials to your banking or other websites you may
have logged into.
Travelers may connect to public wifi to check email, download files, and review work information.
Most businesses have security measures to reduce the risk of connecting over wifi, but
there are still risks when using a public connection.
Session hijacking is when an attacker intercepts and hijacks your connection.
For example, they can take over a connection while you're logged in to your bank and
transfer funds to an outside account.
Shoulder surfing is when an attacker sits strategically in public areas to try to see
usernames and passwords, bank account pins, and other essential information.
To stay safe, use a mobile hotspot or cellular connection.
If public wifi is the only option, be sure to use firewalls, strong passwords, antivirus
and malware software, and VPNs.
Most social network sites operate with secure HTTP or HTTPS, but that doesn't mean they
are safe.
The best way to protect yourself is to:
Make sure the social networking sites you visit are safe before sharing any information.
Learn about their privacy and security settings and use them.
Be careful with the type of information you share on social networking sites.
Not everyone is friendly and cybercriminals will do just about anything to get someone's
personal information.
Avoid clicking suspicious links, emails, tweets, posts, and online advertising.
These are often how cybercriminals try to steal your personal information or hijack
accounts - if it looks suspicious, delete it.
Use strong passwords, as they will make it more difficult to break into your device if
it is lost or stolen.
And as always, keep your software and devices current.
Use the latest security software, web browsers, and operating systems, and encrypt with VPN.
Use a mobile hotspot or cellular connection instead of public wifi.
Instant messaging systems are typically not designed with security features in place.
Senders are not authenticated, and chats can be hijacked, and users impersonated.
Information sent over chat is often in plain text.
That makes it easy to intercept and exploit, especially over public wifi connections.
Never reveal sensitive data over chat.
Files sent by chat are not scanned by computing devices.
Avoid file transfers and links, even if they appear to be from someone you know.
These are the easiest ways for hackers to plant viruses, spyware, keystroke loggers,
phishing scams, spam over instant messaging (SPIM), and a variety of worms.
Instant messaging apps should always have encryption and automatic updates on.
A simple search can tell you if an instant messaging app uses encryption, and how to
access security settings.
Websites relying on the HTTP protocol are not secure, especially when visited over public
wifi.
Everything that you send and receive is in plain text.
It makes you an easy target for cybercriminals.
Secure HTTP, or HTTPS, protocol provides an encrypted connection between you and the sites
that use it.
Most commercial websites, social networking sites, or sites that offer a customer login
use HTTPS.
How do you know a website you're visiting is using secure HTTP?
The easiest way to tell is to see if the URL starts with HTTP or HTTPS.
Or you can look for a lock icon in your browser's URL window.
Clicking the lock shows who owns the digital certificate that proves the server is who
it says it is and if any cookies are in use.
It can also open browser security settings so that you can make adjustments as needed.
It's important to remember that HTTPS only provides a secure connection between you and
the web server.
A site can use HTTPS and still try to scam users or be compromised in some way.
In this video, you learned that:
Your data can be tracked and sold to other parties when using public wifi, public wifi is 
unencrypted and your public data can easily be intercepted and read by
hackers,
social networking sites and instant messaging are vulnerable to cyberthreats,
HTTPS sites are identified by their URL prefix and by the lock icon in the URL window,
and HTTPS provides an encrypted connection but doesn't guarantee that the site is safe.

Security Threats: Safe Browsing Techniques

Welcome to "Security Threats: Safe Browsing Techniques."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
explain what a cache is for, identify safe websites, and list adware risks.
Autofill, or autocomplete, remembers and fills in specific information like passwords or addresses 
in a web browser.
Without it, you'd have to repeatedly fill in passwords and form fields manually.
This can get tedious, especially on mobile keyboards.
You can configure autofill categories such as passwords, payment data, and addresses in your 
browser settings.
When sharing devices with friends and family, set up guest accounts with different browser settings,
and configure syncing so that autofill is only applied to the devices and browsers you want.
A browser cache is a storage area that holds downloaded web pages you've visited.
Cached pages load immediately. If a page has changed since the last cache, it is downloaded, 
displayed, and cached again.
Over time, very large caches cause sluggish performance.
A browser history is a list of every page you've visited and for how long.
Browser histories help you find sites you visited, but they can also be used against you by family, 
hackers, or law enforcement.
Use browser settings to clear history and cache, and to set cache disk space and expiration dates.
Private browsing doesn't save browsing history, cookies, site data, or form data.
With private browsing:
you appear as a new or unknown user on the sites you visit, other people who use the device won't 
see your history, cookies and site data are remembered while browsing but deleted when you exit 
the browser, but private browsing activity isn't hidden from your employer or school,
or your internet service provider (or ISP), the bookmarks you create will be kept.
and downloaded files are saved to your Downloads folder which may be visible to other users.
Malicious websites mimic real websites to trick users into entering login or payment data and can 
install malware that gathers personal information or takes over a device.
Their URLs might use a zero instead of an "O" or a capital "i" instead of a lower case "L".
Their site pages often have typos or designs that don't match the legitimate site they are mimicking.
If you accidentally visit and enter information into a malicious website, exit the site, run antivirus 
and anti-malware, change your password, and (if needed) ask your bank for a new card.
Identifying safe websites is more important than ever. Let's review some safety tips:
Use the Whois Lookup tool to see who owns a site. Missing contact information is a red flag.
Look for reviews. Reddit and other social forums list scam sites and sites with security risks.
Only visit HTTPS sites or your activity could be visible to online predators.
Check the trust seal or security certificate information.
And inspect URLs and site design to avoid malicious websites.
Adware is malware that displays unwanted ads.
Often bundled with apps, it activates on install.
Adware can collect data, track online activity, or link out to malicious websites with viruses.
It can also cause:
sluggish system performance or crashes, changes to your browser's home page, and the appearance 
of new extensions, toolbars, or software, and web pages not displaying properly.
Popup ads and the sudden appearance of unfamiliar apps are the most common way to recognize 
adware.
The aim of redirection is to point you towards certain types of advertising or dangerous code.
Redirection is usually caused by adware or malware.
This includes:
toolbars or browser extensions that show alternate search results loaded with ads,
malware that sabotages searches or typed-in URLs,
and hacked website servers that redirect anyone who visits.
Any connected device can be exploited, especially mobile phones since they don't usually have 
antivirus software and other safeguards.
To avoid hijacking software and redirects, set automatic updates for your browser, OS, and security 
tools, and run regular system scans.
Search engines use algorithms to detect harmful sites. Browsers use those results to warn users.
These sites may contain:
malware, malicious code, phishing scams, or be hacked in some other way.
If your browser tells you a site is unsafe, avoid that site.
In this video, you learned that:
Autofill keeps password, payment, and address data.
Caches store downloaded webpages for fast loading.
Private browsing deletes cookies, history, and cache.
Safe websites use HTTPS, trust seals, and reviews.
Adware can collect data, track online activity, link to malicious sites, and slow system performance.
And search engine algorithms detect dangerous sites.

Virtual Private Networks

Welcome to "Virtual Private Networks."
After watching this video, you will be able to
list the different VPN connection types,
explain the pros and cons of hardware and software VPNs, and identify network hardware that can 
be used to create VPNs.
A virtual private network (or VPN) is an encrypted tunnel set up between two or more sites.
All traffic in the tunnel is unreadable and useless to anyone who might try to intercept the traffic.
VPN traffic is encrypted at the originating site and decrypted at the receiving site.
VPNs make it much more difficult for hackers to make eavesdropping attacks, man in the middle 
attacks, and replay attacks.
This is especially useful if public wifi is your only connection option.
VPNs can be hardware based or software based.
Site-to-site VPN is when two sites connect across an existing internet connection with a VPN 
device.
Each site's internal network traffic is unencrypted.
Traffic that needs to traverse the internet is encrypted by the origination site's VPN and then 
decrypted by the receiving site's VPN device, which then routes the traffic to its intended recipient.
Host-to-site VPN is when a remote user needs to connect securely to a site.
The host device uses VPN software while the site uses a VPN device or software to protect its 
internal network.
Traffic that needs to traverse the internet is encrypted by the sender's VPN, and then decrypted by 
the receiver's VPN, which then receives the traffic if the host is the receiver, or routes it to its 
intended recipient if the site is the receiver.
Host-to-host VPN is when two remote users need to connect securely to each other.
This is a user-to-user or device-to-device interaction that doesn't require a complex encryption 
solution.
Both host devices use VPN software.
Traffic that needs to traverse the internet is encrypted by the sender's VPN, and then decrypted by 
the receiver's VPN.
VPN hardware devices are:
Devices specifically designed to create virtual private networks, or they are existing network 
devices with built-in VPN functionality.
They include routers, firewalls, and VPN concentrators, which can create and manage many VPN 
connections at once.
This is useful in networks that use site-to-site VPN.
VPN software is included in: virtual LANs, and some operating systems and browsers .
For example, the Apple operating system, MacOS, current Windows operating systems, and certain 
browsers like, Opera and Microsoft Edge.
Internet Protocol Security (or IPSec) is a suite of network standards and protocols that use 
cryptography to protect data traveling over the Internet.
The core protocols for the IPSec suite are the IPSec Authentication Header (AH) protocol, 
which authenticates the sender and both IP addresses, and the Encapsulating Security 
Payload (ESP) protocol, which encrypts data and authenticates data and senders.
IPSec has two modes: tunnel mode and transport mode.
In tunnel mode, the entire data packet is wrapped in a new packet, encrypted, and given a new 
header.
Tunnel mode is common in site-to-site VPN.
In transport mode the IP header of the original data packet is left unencrypted.
Only the content of the data packet is encrypted.
Transport mode is common in host-to-site VPN.
The IPSec suite uses many components to support data security.
These include security associations (SA), internet key exchange (IKE), encryption and hashing 
algorithms, and anti-replay protection.
IPSec authenticates data to ensure integrity, encrypts data to ensure confidentiality.
It also protects against replay attacks and enables secure encryption key exchanges.

In this video, you learned that a VPN is an encrypted tunnel set up between two sites,
site-to-site VPNs connect two sites, host-to-site VPNs connect a device to a site, host-to-host VPNs 
connect two devices, VPN concentrators, routers, and firewalls can provide secure VPN 
connections.
The IPSec suite has two modes, tunnel and transport.
The core IPSec protocols are Authentication Header (AH) and Encapsulating Security Payload 
(ESP).

Lesson Summary: Safe Browsing Practices
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	App and software security concerns include accessing and taking over software, files, data, 
and online accounts via PCs that don't have strong passwords, PCs left in unsecured 
physical locations, and via unsecured browsing sessions on non-HTTPS websites.
•	Free and open networks are not encrypted and invite eavesdroppers to view everything you 
send and receive on that network. If a hacker gets access to your device via public Wi-Fi, 
they have free rein over everything on it and can even obtain the credentials to your banking 
or other websites you may have logged into.

Glossary 4

Welcome! This alphabetized glossary contains many of the terms in Module 4. This comprehensive 
glossary also includes additional industry-recognized terms not used in course videos. These terms 
are important for you to recognize when working in the industry, participating in user groups, and 
participating in other certificate programs.
Term
Definition
Access control
Access control prevents unauthorized viewing, modification, or copying 
of data. IT staff use access control to restrict what users can do, which 
resources they have access to, and what functions they are allowed to 
perform. (See RBAC and ROLP.)
Access tokens
Bits of code that signify a user has successfully authenticated their 
identity. Hackers get access tokens by sniffing network traffic between 
trusted entities. Once they find an access token, they can hijack the 
session and use the token to impersonate the trusted entities. After that, 
the hacker can intercept and modify any information sent or access private 
accounts as if they were the account holder. (See Replay attack.)
ActiveX
Old online browser technology for downloading and embedding content 
on websites.
Add-ons
Small bits of code or software applied to browsers to enhance 
functionality and user experience. Add-ons have evolved over the years. 
Toolbars, plug-ins, and extensions are all examples of browser add-ons.
Adware
Software coded into online ads that records your personal data, website 
visits, and keystrokes to send you personalized ads. Adware can be 
legitimate or malicious. Adware is often bundled with apps, it activates on 
install. Adware can collect data, track online activity, or link out to 
malicious websites with viruses. It can also cause sluggish system 
performance, crashes, changes to your browser's home page, the 
appearance of new extensions, toolbars, or software, and web pages not 
displaying properly. Popup ads and the sudden appearance of unfamiliar 
apps are the most common way to recognize adware.
Anti-replay protection
Network standards that stop hackers from re-using data (See IPsec.)
Asymmetric 
encryption
Uses a public key and a private key. It takes longer than symmetric 
encryption because it is more complex. It is used for smaller amounts of 
data. It is safe to widely share the public key for encryption or decryption 
because only the secret key can undo the public key's action. It's used in 
Authentication, digital certificates, digital signatures, and key exchange - 
where a symmetric encryption key is shared only to specific recipients. 
Also called "Public Key Cryptography." (See Symmetric encryption.)
Authentication
The act of confirming the identity of a user. Authentication involves two 
steps: entering the correct login information and confirming that it is 
really you.
Authentication factors
Ways to confirm a user's identity. These include something you know, 
something you have, and something you are. Examples include the answer 
to a security question, a 2FA security card, and a fingerprint scan.
Authentication header 
protocol (AH protocol)
Protocol that authenticates the sender and both IP addresses (See IPsec.)
Authentication 
methods
Ways to log in to a system. These include SSO, 2FA, and MFA.
Authorization
Permission to access a location or do an action. Access control must be set 
up before authorization can be granted.
Autorun
Computer feature that allows inserted drives and disks to run or play 
automatically. Disabling autorun is recommended since it would allow an 
infected drive to install malware automatically the moment it is inserted.
Baiting
In social engineering, the use of a lure just like the bait or lure you'd use 
to catch a fish. Lures can be physical or logical. (See Social engineering.)
Basic Input Output 
System (BIOS)
Firmware that boots up Windows and Linux PCs, runs hardware checks, 
and starts the OS. (See Firmware.)
Basic Input Output 
System password 
(BIOS password)
A security feature that requires a correct password in order to start a 
system's OS. Also called "firmware password." (See Firmware and BIOS.)
Biometrics
Body scan that can confirm whether a person physically accessed a 
device, network, or area. (See Non-repudiation.)
Bloatware
Unwanted trial software, usually pre-loaded on new devices. Aging 
bloatware is soon outdated and may have vulnerabilities.
Browser history
A list of every page you've visited and for how long. Browser histories 
help you find sites you visited, but they can also be used against you by 
family, hackers, or law enforcement. Use browser settings to clear history.
Browsing history
List of recently visited web sites. Anyone with access to your device can 
see what sites you visited. Attackers use browsing history to learn where 
they might impersonate their victims, and companies use it to see which 
sites you go to on your work computer. (See Digital accounting.)
Brute force attacks
A type of password cracking attack where hackers submit as many 
passwords as possible, hoping one will work.
Buffer overflow
Common type of DoS attack that sends a website more Internet traffic 
than it can handle.
Cache
Storage area that holds downloaded web pages you've visited. Cached 
pages load immediately. If a page has changed since the last cache, it is 
downloaded, displayed, and cached again. Over time, very large caches 
cause sluggish performance. Use browser settings to clear the cache, set 
disk space limits, and set expiration dates.
Certificate authority 
(CA)
A trusted organization that issues digital certificates. The major CAs are 
Apple, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Google. Which CA your device uses 
depends on the operating system it's running. Also called 'Root certificate 
store.' (See Digital certificate, SSL certificates, and HTTPS websites.)
CIA Triad
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality means that data 
is protected from unauthorized access. Integrity means that data is 
protected from unauthorized changes. And availability means that you 
have access to your data whenever you need it.
Cipher
An algorithm that is used to scramble plain text, so it is secure.
Ciphertext
Plain text that is encrypted, which makes it unreadable.
Company Confidential 
Information
Any information that is used to run a company, like intellectual property, 
product designs, procedures, plans, employee records, and financial data. 
(See Confidential information.)
Confidential 
information
Information that must be kept secret. Employees are trained to recognize 
and deal with confidential information so that it remains secure. 
Companies rank information and files by how sensitive each one is. Each 
company ranks their information differently, but there are four main types 
of confidential information that should be universally protected: PII, 
Company Confidential information, Customer Confidential Information, 
and PHI.
Cookies
Text files with small pieces of data. When you visit a site, the server 
creates a cookie and saves it on your browser to track you. Cookies let 
websites remember your logins, shopping carts, and more. This creates an 
easier, more personalized online experience. Cookies can also be used to 
ban you from a website if you've violated any of its conditions for use. 
Most cookies are safe, but some are designed to track without consent. 
Even legitimate cookies can be harmful if you get hacked. (See Digital 
accounting.)
Cookies, 
authentication
Authentication cookies save logins, usernames, and passwords, so you 
don't have to remember them.
Cookies, session
Session cookies are used only for one session. They are stored in RAM 
and are automatically deleted when the browsing session ends.
Cookies, third-party
Third-party cookies are from sites you are not on. These track you across 
the web. Ads can generate cookies, even if you never click on them.
Cookies, zombie
Zombie cookies are third-party cookies that don't follow normal cookie 
protocols. They can store their code directly on your device to recreate 
themselves even after deletion. They are extremely difficult to remove. 
Websites may also use zombie cookies to ban specific users.
Cryptographic hash
A short string of numbers and letters created by running a password or file 
through an algorithm. A single password and a full library will have 
different cryptographic hashes, but each hash will have the same number 
of characters. If any data is altered or removed from a password or file, its 
cryptographic hash will be different. When you create a password, it's 
converted into a cryptographic hash. On your next log in, it's converted 
again. If the stored hash and the new hash match, the system lets you in. 
Cryptographic hashes save space, authenticate data, and keep information 
secure.
Customer Confidential 
Information
Information customers or partners provide to companies, which includes 
PII and also things like purchase histories, and credit card information. 
(See Confidential information.)
Data
Raw values and facts are usually collected by automated systems. For 
example, page visits, link clicks, and monthly sales. (See Information, 
Insights, and Data analytics.)
Data analytics
The processing of raw data, like values or facts to create meaningful 
information. (See Information, Insights, and Data.)
Data at rest
Data that resides on a storage device. The files aren't open or being 
transmitted anywhere. Data at rest can be encrypted at the file level, 
storage device level, and cloud level. Encryption at the file level lets you 
encrypt all your files on a storage device or just a select few. Data at rest 
is less vulnerable than data in motion, but it's not immune from attacks.
Data availability
Data availability means that authorized users have immediate and reliable 
access to their data. This includes granting access to authorized users with 
passwords and security questions. Data availability can be compromised 
by hardware failures, unscheduled software downtime, network 
bandwidth issues, cyberattacks and sabotage. To protect against these 
threats, systems that require high availability (99.999% uptime) have 
network monitoring, redundant systems, and backup servers ready to take 
over. If the primary system is compromised, business continuity and 
customer access can be maintained.
Data breaches
Data breaches are when a data leak is caused intentionally by a 
cybercriminal. These occur when social engineering or phishing attacks 
trick employees into leaking sensitive credentials or information.
Data capture
The collection of data from multiple sources and the secure storage of it in 
relational databases, or more commonly, semi-structured data warehouses. 
Data may be captured by server logs showing where customers browse, 
IoT sensors in home appliances and business technology, or customer and 
employee surveys or rating systems. (See Data correlation and 
Meaningful reporting.)
Data confidentiality
The control of data access and the use of security tools like encryption 
and multifactor authentication (MFA) to keep data secure. Data 
confidentiality prevents identity theft, compromised accounts and 
systems, legal concerns, damage to reputation, and other severe 
consequences. To determine if data should be confidential, ask: Who is 
authorized? Do confidentiality regulations apply? Are there conditions for 
when data can be accessed? What would the impact of disclosure be? Is 
the data valuable?
Data correlation
When raw data points are analyzed to find connections or links. For 
example, Netflix uses tools that compare searches, views, and ratings so 
they can predict which movies and shows will be successful on their 
platform. AI and machine learning algorithms automate parts of the 
analysis. (See Data capture and Meaningful reporting.)
Data dumps
Data dumps are when cybercriminals dump stolen data onto the dark web 
for monetary gain. A data dump might include PII, PHI, bank account 
numbers, PINs, social security numbers, and more. Other cybercriminals 
buy and use data dumps for things like identity theft and password 
attacks.
Data in motion
Data that is actively moving between two devices - meaning two 
computers, a mobile device and a mail server, or your computer and your 
bank's online website. Data in motion is especially at risk for interception 
attacks like man-in-the-middle. Also called data in transit.
Data in transit
(See data in motion.)
Data integrity
The collection of actions and fail safes that protect data. Data integrity 
guarantees that data is accurate, complete, and consistent. It covers data in 
storage, during processing, and in transit. The two main types of data 
integrity are physical and logical. Without data integrity, loss, corruption, 
or compromise can cause significant damage and financial loss for both 
businesses and customers.
Data integrity (logical)
Logical data integrity are the checks and protocols that protect data from 
human error and hackers. These confirm that data is correct and accurate 
as it's used in different ways within an organization.
Data integrity 
(physical)
Physical data integrity is the collection of actions and fail safes that 
protect the physical systems that store and process the data.
Data leaks
The accidental exposure of confidential or sensitive data through a 
security vulnerability.
Data-driven business 
decisions
Business decisions based on data capture, data correlation, and 
meaningful reporting.
Distributed denial of 
service attack (DDoS 
attack)
DoS attack made with a large collection of compromised, malware-
infected computers known as a botnet. It's harder to identify a DDoS 
attack's origin, which makes it harder to shut down. And DDoS attacks are 
far more devastating than DoS attacks since hundreds or thousands of 
computers are used instead of just one.
Decryption key
(See Encryption key.)
Default usernames and 
passwords
The default login information that comes with new hardware or software. 
These are essential to tech support, software installation, and device 
configuration. They have admin-level privileges and hide who's using 
them, as they aren't associated with any registered users. Hackers use 
them to break into apps, devices, OSes, databases, and BIOS since they 
are easily found online in help guides or user manuals.
Denial of Service 
(DoS)
Cyberattack, where a website or server is targeted with so much traffic 
that it overwhelms that system, degrading performance until the server is 
unable to respond.
Denial of service 
attack (DoS attack)
Cyberattack that floods a network with so much traffic that it crashes. 
DoS attack victims are typically high-profile, like government sites, 
banks, or social media sites. Sometimes, DoS attacks are used to distract 
from other attacks happening at the same time.
Device lock
The literal locking of a device-either physically, behind a locked door, or 
with a steel cable and padlock; or digitally with passwords or PINs.
Dictionary attacks
A type of password cracking attack where hackers use words pulled from 
dictionaries or newspapers to crack passwords.
Digital accounting
Investigating online and network activity to discover the reasons behind a 
certain outcome. Digital accounting is used in troubleshooting, security 
analysis, forensics, and hacking.
Digital certificate
A security approval that includes a public encryption key that encrypts 
data. If the data recipient trusts the CA that issued the digital certificate, 
they use a private key to decrypt the data. Digital certificates are also used 
in smart card authentication. (See CA and PKI.)
Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act 
(DMCA)
Law that makes it illegal to bypass copy protections or to develop 
technology that helps bypass copy protections. (See DRM and Digital 
products.)
Digital products
Non-tangible assets a company owns, like software, online music, online 
courses, e-books, audiobooks, and web elements like WordPress templates 
or Shopify themes. (See DRM and DMCA.)
Digital receipt
Encryption and authentication method used to prove that a message was 
sent from one party to another. (See Non-repudiation.)
Digital Rights 
Management (DRM)
Code added directly to files that helps prevent digital assets from being 
copied or pirated, but there are tools that can remove DRM code. (See 
Digital products and DMCA.)
Digital signatures
A regular signature used in conjunction with a hardware or software 
token. This authenticates the signer. The sender sends an encrypted 
signature and a public decryption key to a recipient. If the recipient can 
decrypt the signature with the public key, that proves the sender signed it 
because they must have performed the encryption with the private key. 
(See PKI and Non-repudiation.)
Drive encryption
The scrambling of a drive's data so it's unreadable. (See Firmware.)
Dumpster diving
Dumpster diving is the act of physically searching through a literal 
dumpster to find something valuable. A company's trash might contain 
lists of customer names, phone numbers, contact information, business 
plans, product designs, or an access code written on a post-it note. Tech 
companies require document shredding and device destruction as a 
normal part of business because these can be stolen from the trash to 
harvest data that can be used for identity theft and data breaches. Or the 
data could be sold to hackers or a company's competitors.
Eavesdropping
When hackers use a packet sniffer to read unencrypted network traffic so 
they can intercept, alter, or delete data transmitted between devices. 
Eavesdropping (or packet sniffing) attacks occur on wireless, wired, and 
phone connections. Staying off public wifi or using encryption with a 
VPN or cellular connection helps prevent eavesdropping attacks. 
Eavesdropping is also called "packet sniffing". (See Packet sniffer.)
Email management
Classifying email messages and deciding whether they should be saved or 
deleted. It helps prioritize emails, saves time, and increases productivity. 
It includes using folders and subfolders, using rules or filters, 
unsubscribing from email lists, and configuring settings to block spam.
Encapsulating security 
payload protocol (ESP 
protocol)
Protocol that encrypts data and authenticates data and senders. (See 
IPsec.)
Encryption
Encryption is the act of taking readable plain text and scrambling it into 
unreadable ciphertext with an algorithm, so it can only be read by a 
recipient that has the decryption key. Encryption is used at the network 
layer for data traveling across networks. It can also be done locally to hard 
drives, phones, and even thumb drives so that lost device data remains 
unreadable. In some industries, data encryption is a mandatory 
requirement. This includes student records, medical records, and 
consumer data. Many OSes have encryption built in. For those that don't, 
third-party encryption software is available.
Encryption and 
hashing algorithms
Algorithms that scramble data. (See IPsec.)
Encryption key
A series of random, unique numbers combined with very powerful 
algorithms that are used to encrypt (or scramble) data before it is sent. The 
person on the receiving end has a decryption key that's used to decrypt (or 
unscramble) the data, so it's in a readable or usable format.
Exploits
Pieces of code that use vulnerabilities in hardware or software to get into 
a system. Malware-infected websites use exploits to automatically 
download malware to a system. This is called a drive-by download.
Extension
Small piece of source code that adds a function or feature to a browser. 
Ad-blockers and in-browser PDF readers are extensions. Since extensions 
are given special authorizations within the browser, they are attractive 
targets for attackers. (See Add-ons.)
File integrity 
monitoring (FIM)
Software that audits sensitive files and folders to ensure all activity is 
authorized.
Firewall
Software or hardware that monitors connections and blocks harmful 
traffic based on preset rules. For example, schools and businesses use 
firewalls to block social media sites, age-inappropriate content, and 
certain types of downloads.
Firmware
Firmware is software that tells hardware how to behave. Security 
firmware protects devices and data from malware and tampering. 
Outdated firmware leaves devices vulnerable.
Firmware password
A security feature that requires a correct password in order to start a 
system's OS. Also called 'firmware password." (See Firmware and 
BIOS.)
General Data 
Protection Regulation 
(GDPR)
Set of regulations that mandate digital privacy for all countries in the 
European Union.
Hardening
The process of securing a device to minimize vulnerabilities. This 
includes disabling unneeded device features, regularly updating a device's 
firmware, OS, and software, and using firewalls, VPNs, and antimalware. 
(See Patches.)
Hashing
Hashing is when an algorithm transforms an input string (like your 
password) into a smaller, fixed-length output string (or hash) that's saved 
to a file. A hash is like a digital fingerprint. Passwords are hashed with a 
scrambling algorithm. If a password hash is determined, attackers can use 
it to determine other passwords that were scrambled in the same way-
that can be over 90% of unknown passwords in some cases. (See 
Password hash.)
Health Insurance 
Portability and 
Accountability Act 
(HIPAA)
Set of regulations that mandate the use and disclosure of protected health 
information in America.
Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol Script 
protocol (HTTP 
protocol)
A protocol that governs the flow of online traffic.
HTTP websites
Websites relying on the HTTP protocol are not secure, especially when 
visited over public wifi. Everything that you send and receive is in plain 
text. It makes you an easy target for cybercriminals. (See HTTPS 
websites.)
Hypertext Transfer 
Protocol Script Secure 
protocol (HTTPS 
protocol)
A protocol that governs the flow of online traffic and provides encryption 
for security.
HTTPS websites
Secure HTTP, or HTTPS, protocol provides an encrypted connection 
between you and the sites that use it. Most commercial websites, social 
networking sites, or sites that offer a customer login use HTTPS. The 
easiest way to tell is to see if a website is HTTPS is if the URL starts with 
HTTPS. Or you can look for a lock icon in your browser's URL window 
to confirm that site's digital certificate and other security information. 
HTTPS websites only provides a secure connection between you and the 
web server. A site can use HTTPS and still try to scam users or be 
compromised in some way. (See HTTP websites and SSL certificates.)
ICMP flood
Common type of DoS attack where diagnostic pings are sent to every 
computer on a network. Each computer pings every other computer, and 
so on, until the network crashes.
Identity fraud
The act of using the personal, private, or financial information stolen from 
victims to commit fraud. (See Identity theft.)
Identity theft
The act of stealing personal, private, or financial information from a 
person with the intent of using it to assume the victim's identity and to 
commit fraud. (See Identity fraud.)
Impersonation
When a hacker sets up a public wifi network that seems legitimate. Once a 
user connects, login credentials, session information, and PII can be 
intercepted. Or when a hacker sets up a fake website that looks and feels 
exactly like a real website, such as a well-known bank or other high-
profile site. They may send fake email or text links (known as phishing) to 
trick you into visiting the fake site so they can steal your credentials to the 
real site and install malware on your device. A third type of impersonation 
is when a hacker pretends to be someone else so they can steal data or 
take over systems. This is also called social engineering. Impersonation 
attacks can be used individually or in combination with each other.
Incognito mode
(See Private browsing.)
Information
A summary of raw data. For example, positive or negative results that 
happen after some specific change. (See Data, Insights, and Data 
analytics.)
Information asset
Information or data that has value. Like patient records, customer 
information, and intellectual property. Information assets can exist 
physically, on paper, on disks or other media, or they can exist 
electronically in databases and files.
Insights
Conclusions based on the results of information analysis. Meaningful 
business decisions are based on insights. For example, if a positive trend 
occurs after store hours are changed, the right business decision would be 
to maintain those new hours. (See Information, Data, and Data analytics.)
Intellectual property 
(IP)
Creations of the mind that are generally are not tangible. Often protected 
by copyright, trademark, and patent law. Examples of IP include industrial 
designs, trade secrets, research discoveries, and even some employee 
knowledge. Companies use a legally binding document called a Non-
Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to prevent the sharing of IP and other 
sensitive information.
Internet key exchange 
(IKE)
Secure exchange of cryptographic keys. (See IPsec.)
Internet Protocol 
Security (IPsec)
A suite of network standards and protocols that use cryptography to 
protect data traveling over the Internet. The core protocols for the IPsec 
suite are the AH and ESP protocols. To support data security, the IPsec 
suite uses security associations (SA), Internet key exchange (IKE), 
encryption and hashing algorithms, and anti-replay protection. IPsec has 
two modes: tunnel mode and transport mode.
IPsec transport mode
In IPsec transport mode, the IP header of the original data packet is left 
unencrypted. Only the content of the data packet is encrypted. Transport 
mode is common in host-to-site VPN. (See IPsec.)
IPsec tunnel mode
In IPsec tunnel mode, the entire data packet is wrapped in a new packet, 
encrypted, and given a new header. Tunnel mode is common in site-to-site 
VPN. (See IPsec.)
Jailbreaking
When users remove device restrictions on Apple iPhones so they can 
make changes and install non-approved apps. This adds functionality but 
also adds vulnerability. It is harder to jailbreak newer model phones, and 
there is less reason for it with updated features and app selections. (See 
Rooting.)
Java
Programming language used to enhance website interactivity.
Logical lure
An online ad or social media platform that looks too good to be true so 
users will click the ad to find out more. It's a set up so an attacker can 
infect their computer with malware to gain access to login credentials, 
financial information, and other valuable data. (See Social engineering 
and Baiting.)
LogsFiles
that capture access, changes, error messages, and other basic information. 
Most software and systems generate audit logs. Audit logs capture log file 
events which can show who did what and how the system behaved. (See 
Digital accounting.)
Macro viruses
Bits of code that affect Microsoft Office files via the macros they use to 
automate tasks.
Malicious websites
Websites that mimic real websites to trick users into entering login or 
payment data or to install malware that gathers personal information or 
takes over a device. Malicious website pages often have typos or designs 
that don't match the legitimate site they are mimicking. Their URLs might 
use a zero instead of an "O" or a capital "i" instead of a lower case "L".
Malware
A general term for software designed to compromise computer systems. 
Malware can cause system slowdowns, odd requests, browser 
misdirection, and popup ads. It can also steal data, record everything you 
do with or near your device, spam your contacts with infected links, and 
connect your computer to a network of hijacked computers that are 
remotely controlled (known as a botnet). Malware can come from 
attachments, sketchy websites, file downloads, infected USB drives, or 
links in emails, ads, social media, torrents, and even text messages. 
Malware types include viruses, worms, trojans, exploits, spyware, adware, 
and ransomware.
Man-in-the-middle 
attack
A man-in-the-middle attack is a form of eavesdropping. It has a victim, a 
receipt point, and an attacker. The victim and receipt point are unaware 
the attacker is listening in. Man-in-the-middle attacks can be physical or 
logical. Other man-in-the-middle attacks include spoofing, hijacking, and 
theft of browser cookies. (See Eavesdropping.)
Man-in-the-middle 
attack (logical)
In a logical man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker sends emails or texts 
with fake links that direct victims to sites that steal their data and install 
malware. If a fake email warned about a bank account problem, the victim 
might click the link and try to login. This gives the attacker control of 
their bank account and installs malware on the victim's computer.
Man-in-the-middle 
attack (physical)
In a physical man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker is physically near the 
victim, like the same public wifi network or a network they set up 
themselves as a trap. The attacker sniffs the unencrypted network traffic to 
gain access to everything the victim is doing online so they can steal 
information.
Meaningful reporting
The presentation of analyzed information in ways that help people further 
analyze and interpret. Reporting tools use captured and correlated data to 
provide charts, keyword searches, and graphs that help companies achieve 
business insights. (See Data correlation and Data capture.)
Multi-factor 
authentication (MFA)
Authentication method that requires multiple authentication factors before 
authentication is granted. Usually, MFA requires that you fill in a code 
sent to your email or phone to prove that a login attempt came from you.
Near field 
communication (NFC)
Wireless technology that transfers data across devices with a tap or a 
bump. It's usually used for payments or sharing contacts. It has a much 
shorter range than Bluetooth and has zero security protections aside from 
its limited range.
Non-repudiation
When you can't deny being in a specific location. It guarantees that a 
message sent between two parties is genuine. Non-repudiation examples 
include video, biometrics, digital signature, and digital receipt. (See Non-
repudiation.)
Open network
Free, unencrypted networks that do not require a password to log on. 
Airports, coffee shops, hotels and even fast-food restaurants offer their 
guests access to open networks. Open network providers may track what 
you do and sell your data to advertisers. Open networks also invite 
eavesdroppers to view everything sent and received on that network. On 
unprotected devices, they can install malware or hijack user sessions. Also 
called 'unsecure network' and 'public wifi'.
Original equipment 
manufacturer (OEM)
The original maker of a hardware device. OEMs provide drivers and 
firmware updates on their websites.
Packet sniffer
A packet sniffer is a tool that intercepts everything transmitted on a 
network. Anything your device sends on an unencrypted network can be 
viewed with a packet sniffer. If a network is encrypted, packet sniffers 
will only be able to see things like the origin and destination of a packet 
but not the data inside it. (See Eavesdropping.)
Packet sniffing
(See Eavesdropping.)
Password cracking
Getting a correct password in an unauthorized way.
Password hash
The string of letters and numbers that result after a password is processed 
by a scrambling algorithm. (See Hashing.)
Patches
Patches are updates to apps and OSes that fix security weaknesses. 
Companies regularly release patches alongside system improvement 
updates to make sure that their customers are safe from new threats. But 
patches are a response to KNOWN threats-meaning the threat has 
already happened to someone. (See Hardening.)
Personally Identifiable 
Information (PII)
Any information that can be used to identify someone, like government 
ID numbers, birthdates, addresses, and phone numbers. (See Confidential 
information.)
Phishing
Email or text-based social engineering attacks that hackers use to steal 
usernames and passwords, bank account information, Social Security 
numbers, and more. Phishing attacks make it look like the email or 
message came from a friend or family member, or someone official like a 
bank, the government, or a large company. They use fear, greed, or a 
sense of urgency, so users are more likely to make a rush decision and 
click a malware-infected link or attachment. For example, a data breach 
alert from your bank that includes a password reset link. The email 
message and website were fake, and your password was never reset. 
Phishing emails usually have typos and grammatical errors. (See Social 
engineering.)
Physical lure
A physical object, such as a malware-infected USB flash drive that's been 
deliberately left somewhere in the hope that someone will take the drive 
and plug it into their computer. It's a set up so an attacker can gain access 
to login credentials, financial information, and other valuable data. (See 
Social engineering and Baiting.)
Plain text
Data that has not been encrypted.
Plug-ins
Site-specific browser add-ons that you click on to install. They are not 
supported in today's modern browsers, in favor of extensions. (See Add-
ons.)
Polymorphic viruses
Bits of code that change their characteristics to get around cybersecurity 
defenses. 97% of all malware uses polymorphic viruses.
Pretexting
When an attacker poses or impersonates someone with authority - such as 
a police officer, someone from your bank, a tax official, or one of your co-
workers. They can use a sense of fear, intimidation, friendliness, 
sympathy, or urgency to try to trick or pressure you into confirming your 
identity under the pretense that they need something from you or need you 
to perform some critical or urgent task for them. (See Social engineering.)
Private browsing
Browser setting that doesn't save browsing history, cookies, site data, or 
form data. Also called 'incognito mode'. Private browsing users appear as 
a new or unknown user on sites, and other people who use the device 
won't see private browsing history, and cookies and site data are 
remembered while browsing but deleted when the browser is closed. But 
private browsing activity isn't hidden from employers, schools, or ISPs. 
Also, any bookmarks or downloads created during private browsing will 
be kept.
Program viruses
Bits of code that insert themselves into another program.
Protected Health 
Information (PHI)
Any information added to a person's medical record during diagnosis or 
treatment that can be used to identify them, like PII, medical history, 
prescription lists, photos, and more. (See Confidential information.)
Public key 
infrastructure (PKI)
When a user is validated with a digital certificate by a Certificate 
Authority. (See Smart card authentication, Digital certificate, and Digital 
signatures.)
Public wifi
(See Open network.)
Rainbow attacks
A type of password cracking attack where hackers use words from an 
original password hash to generate all other possible passwords.
Ransomware
Software that locks a system, encrypts its files, and displays a ransom 
demand. To get the encryption key, you must pay the ransom. Or you can 
regain access by doing a full system restore from a backup.
Relational database 
management system 
(RDBMS)
A database that records user access and data changes. RDBMS is safer 
than a spreadsheet program.
Replay attack
A type of man-in-the-middle attack which intercepts and retransmits data. 
Replay attacks involve "trusted entities" and require an "access token". 
Replay attacks are also known as repeat or playback attacks.
Role-based access 
control (RBAC)
Access control method that follows a company's org chart. Different 
customer and employee roles are set up as groups on a network, and then 
those groups are granted certain permissions. When a new user joins the 
network, they are assigned to the group that fits their role. They will have 
the lowest level of permissions they need to do their job. (See Access 
control and ROLP.)
Root certificate store
(See CA and SSL certificates.)
Rooting
When users remove device restrictions on Android phones so they can 
make changes and install non-approved apps. This adds functionality but 
also adds vulnerability. It is harder to root newer model phones, and there 
is less reason for it with updated features and app selections. (See 
Jailbreaking.)
Rule of least privilege 
(ROLP)
Access control method where access is only granted to resources that a 
user needs to fulfill their role. (See RBAC and Access control.)
Search engine 
algorithms
Algorithms used by search engines that detect harmful sites. Browsers use 
those results to warn users that a site may contain malware, malicious 
code, phishing scams, or be hacked in some other way. If your browser 
tells you a site is unsafe, avoid that site.
Secure boot
A feature of UEFI. It confirms an OS manufacturer's digital signature, 
which prevents malware from taking control during boot-up. (See 
Firmware and UFEI.)
Secure sockets layer 
certificates (SSL 
certificates)
Certificate that authenticates a website's identity and enables an encrypted 
connection between a web server and a browser. SSL certificates come 
from CAs. When you browse a website using HTTPS, you're trusting the 
CA to validate the information submitted by the business who has 
requested an SSL certificate. Businesses need SSL security certificates for 
their websites so they can keep user data secure, verify their ownership of 
the site, prevent attackers from creating fake versions of their site, and to 
convey trust to users. They also need them if they want to have an HTTPS 
web address. When you see a lock icon in the address bar of a URL you 
visited, then you know that website is using HTTPS. Also called 'security 
certificate' and 'trust seal'. (See CA and HTTPS websites.)
Security associations 
(SA)
Defines which types of hashing and encryption are used (See IPsec.)
Security certificate
(See SSL certificate.)
Security zones
A feature of older browsers. They block or allow websites and confine 
them to different zones such as the local network, Internet, or intranet. For 
each zone you could apply different security levels. For example, 
medium, high, or custom. Security zones can also be configured to allow 
ActiveX and Java for added website interactivity or functionality, but this 
introduces risk. Modern browsers do not use Zones. Older web apps may 
require you to enable ActiveX in order to run properly.
Session hijacking
When an attacker intercepts and hijacks your connection. For example, 
they can take over a connection while you're logged in to your bank and 
transfer funds to an outside account.
Shoulder surfing
When an attacker sits strategically in public areas to try to see usernames 
and passwords, bank account pins, and other essential information. They 
literally watch what you enter on your screen and look at your finger's 
keystrokes, too. Shoulder surfing is common in busy public places.
Smart card 
authentication
User authentication using a card that has a security chip. The smart card 
has a public/private key pair. It presents a digital certificate (including the 
public key) to the server it's trying to access. If the server trusts the CA 
that issued the digital certificate, it will use the public key to send an 
encrypted request. Only the smart card's private key can decrypt the 
request, which means only the smart card owner can send the correct 
response. (See PKI and digital certificate.)
Snooping
Cyberattack that intercepts data between devices. Snooping can reveal 
logins, credit card numbers, intellectual property, and more. Snooping 
attack types include: eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle, and replay. Some 
hackers can even use a computer monitor's electromagnetic fields to 
reconstruct what it displays. Snooping is common on open, unsecured 
networks and can be difficult to trace.
Social engineering
The use of psychological manipulation to trick people into giving away 
sensitive information or getting them to make security-related mistakes. 
Attackers try to gain a victim's trust and then try to manipulate that person 
into doing what the attackers want them to do. Often times, the sense of 
fear or urgency is used to further the process along. Social engineering is 
a trap. It relies on human error. (See Pretexting, Baiting, and Phishing.)
Software or license 
theft
The unauthorized copy or use of copyright-protected software. This 
includes pirating software and counterfeiting activation codes.
Spam
Unwanted, unsolicited digital communication sent out in bulk to multiple 
recipients at once. Much of the time, it is sent from unknown senders. It 
comes in the forms of email, text messages, instant messages, robocalls 
and social media. It is junk, typically used for advertising products, goods, 
or services, but it can also be used to distribute malware. Your company 
and web-based email services filter out most spam at the email server 
level and block domains known for sending spam. But some still gets 
through. Some spam is harmless, but it can be dangerous when scammers 
use it to commit phishing attacks or fraud against you.
Spyware
Software collects personal data, login credentials, credit card information, 
online activity, and can record using a device's camera or microphone. 
Spyware can be legitimate or malicious.
Single sign-on (SSO)
Authentication method that lets you log in to multiple applications and 
platforms with one login.
Stealth viruses
Bits of code that copy themselves to different locations to avoid antivirus 
scans.
Strong password
Passwords that are long, difficult to guess, and have a mix of numbers, 
letters, symbols, and capitalizations. For example: the phrase, "Johnny 
Appleseed loves apples" would be a very strong password, especially if it 
included a mix of numbers and symbols.
Symmetric encryption
When a single key is used between parties to encrypt and decrypt data. 
With only one key, it uses less memory, which is great for quickly and 
securely processing larger amounts of data. That's why it is often used to 
protect the main data exchange in a session. But it's harder to keep a 
single key secret, especially if it needs to be broadly distributed. If this 
key is intercepted by a hacker, then they can decrypt messages, hack 
accounts, and steal or tamper with data. 3DES and CAST are examples of 
symmetric encryption technologies. Also called "single-key" or "private 
key" encryption. (See Asymmetric encryption.)
SYN flood
Common type of DoS attack that sends a rapid series of incomplete 
connection requests which flood a website until the server crashes.
Toolbars
Toolbars were designed to add functionality to the browser, like spell 
check, auto fill, yellow pages, and dictionaries. But most toolbars were 
considered nuisance-ware. Some would show sponsored results instead of 
what you originally searched for, or they'd impede system performance. 
Some even installed malware, tracked browsing habits, and collected user 
data. Toolbars used to be forcibly installed on user devices during 
software installation processes. Fortunately, toolbars are a thing of the 
past. (See Add-ons.)
Tracking
Following a person to see where they go and what they do. Websites can 
track your OS, browser version, installed extensions, screen resolution, 
installed fonts, time zone, language, and how long you spent on a site and 
what you did there. (See Digital accounting.)
Trojans
Bits of code that trick you into installing legitimate-seeming software that 
includes harmful malware.
Trust seal
(See SSL certificate.)
Trusted entities
Users or websites that get an access token (or security key) after verifying 
that they are who they say they are. For example, connecting to your bank 
or your work network on a network-registered device. (See Replay 
attack.)
Trusted Platform 
Module (TPM)
A chip that stores and manages encryption keys. TPM chips won't start a 
device or unencrypt data if tampering is detected. (See Firmware.)
Two-factor 
authentication (2FA)
Authentication method that requires an authentication device before 
authentication is granted.
Unified Extensible 
Firmware Interface 
(UEFI)
Newer and more advanced boot firmware. (See Firmware.)
Unsecure network
(See Open network.)
Viruses
Programs designed to spread from host to host, just like real viruses. An 
infected app or file has to be started by a user for a virus to activate. 
Viruses can turn on a webcam, record keystrokes and site visits, steal data, 
corrupt files, and hijack email accounts.
Virtual Private 
Network (VPN)
Technology that encrypts the traffic coming out of your device or site. 
Even if a hacker captures your data, they won't be able to read it or 
decrypt it. A VPN is an encrypted tunnel set up between two or more sites. 
All traffic in the tunnel is unreadable and useless to anyone who might try 
to intercept the traffic. VPN traffic is encrypted at the originating site and 
decrypted at the receiving site. VPNs make it much more difficult for 
hackers to make eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and 
replay attacks. This is especially useful if public wifi is your only 
connection option. VPNs can be hardware based or software based.
VPN hardware device
Device specifically designed to create VPNs or network devices with 
added VPN functionality. They include VPN concentrators, routers, and 
firewalls.
VPN, host-to-host
Host-to-host VPN is when two remote users need to connect securely to 
each other. This user-to-user or device-to-device interaction doesn't 
require a complex encryption solution. Both host devices use VPN 
software. Traffic that needs to traverse the internet is encrypted by the 
sender's VPN and then decrypted by the receiver's VPN. (See VPN, or 
virtual private network.)
VPN, host-to-site
Host-to-site VPN is when a remote user needs to connect securely to a 
site. The host device uses VPN software while the site uses a VPN device 
or software to protect its internal network. Traffic that needs to traverse 
the internet is encrypted by the sender's VPN and then decrypted by the 
receiver's VPN, which then receives the traffic if the host is the receiver, 
or routes it to its intended recipient if the site is the receiver. (See VPN.)
VPN, site-to-site
Site-to-site VPN is when two sites connect across an existing internet 
connection with a VPN device. Each site's internal network traffic is 
unencrypted. Traffic that needs to traverse the internet is encrypted by the 
origination site's VPN and then decrypted by the receiving site's VPN 
device, which then routes the traffic to its intended recipient. (See VPN.)
Whois Lookup tool
Online tool that shows who owns a site.
Windows Defender
Pre-loaded anti-malware software from Microsoft. Windows Defender 
protects your computer against viruses and malware for free. It also 
integrates with the built-in firewall that comes with the Windows 
operating system and is enabled by default. However, Windows Defender 
does not perform VPN functions.
Wiretapping
Covertly intercepting phone-based and internet-based 
telecommunications. Any type of traffic is a target: computer 
transmissions, phone calls, texts, social media updates, and fax 
transmissions. This can be done legally with a warrant, or it can be used 
illegally in cyberattacks. Wiretapping only involves listening. It cannot 
alter or stop data. Wiretapping is also known as lawful interception.
Worms
Viruses that start themselves after identifying system weaknesses. They 
don't rely on apps or files. Unlike viruses, worms can be controlled 
remotely.



Definition and Essential Characteristics of Cloud 
Computing


Cloud computing, also referred to as "the cloud," is the delivery of on-demand computing
resources. Everything from applications to data centers, over the internet on a pay-for-use
basis.
To get a common understanding of cloud computing, let's start with the US National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST's) definition of cloud computing.
NIST defines cloud computing as a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access
to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, that can be rapidly provisioned
and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
Examples of computing resources include networks, servers, storage, applications, and services.
This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three deployment models,
and three service models.
Let's start with understanding the five essential characteristics of the cloud, which
include on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity,
and measured service.
On-demand Self-service, the 1st characteristic, means that you get access to cloud resources
such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a simple interface,
without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
The 2nd characteristic, Broad Network Access, means that cloud computing resources can be
accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones,
tablets, laptops, and workstations.
The 3rd characteristic, Resource Pooling, is what gives cloud providers economies of
scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient.
Using a multi-tenant model, computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers; cloud
resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned, according to demand, without customers 
needing
to concern themselves with the physical location of these resources.
Rapid Elasticity, the 4th characteristic, implies that you can access more resources
when you need them, and scale back when you don't, because resources are elastically
provisioned and released.
And the 5th characteristic, Measured Service, means that you only pay for what you use or
reserve as you go. if you're not using resources, you're not paying.
Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.
As we see, cloud computing is really about utilizing technology "as a service", leveraging
remote systems on-demand over the open internet, scaling up and scaling back, and paying 
for what you use.
It is a revolution in that it has changed the way the world consumes compute services,
by making them more cost-efficient while also making organizations more agile in responding
to changes in their markets.
As I mentioned earlier in this talk, the cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics,
three deployment models, and three service models.
We just went over the five essential characteristics.
While we will go into greater depth of the deployment and the service models in the later
videos, let me leave you with a brief overview of these models.
There are three types of cloud deployment models-Public, Private, and Hybrid.
Public cloud is when you leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by
the cloud provider, but its usage is shared by other companies.
Private cloud means that the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single
organization.
It could run on-premises or it could be owned, managed, and operated by a service provider.
And when you use a mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly,
that is classified as the Hybrid model.
Now, let's look at the three service models that are based on the three layers in a computing
stack - Infrastructure, Platform, and Applications.
These cloud computing models are aptly referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas),
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
In an Infrastructure as a Service model, you get access to infrastructure and physical
computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space - without the
need to manage or operate them.
In a Platform as a Service model, you get access to the platform, that is the hardware
and software tools, usually those needed to develop and deploy applications to users over
the Internet.
Software as a Service is a software licensing and delivery model in which software and applications
are centrally hosted and licensed on a subscription basis, and sometimes also referred to as "on-
demand software."
In the next training, we will go over some of the key evolutions that brings us to what
cloud computing is today.

Reading: Cloud Adoption - No Longer a Choice

Cloud adoption is no longer a thing of the future. From a single individual to a global multi-billion-
dollar enterprise, anybody can access the computing capacity they need on the cloud. The lag time 
from decision to value is no longer a journey of years with high upfront capital.
Cloud makes it possible for businesses to experiment, fail, and learn much faster than ever before, 
with low-risk exposure. Businesses today have greater freedom to change course than to live with 
the consequences of expensive decisions taken in the past.
According to a study conducted by the IBM Institute of Business Value, over three-quarters of 
enterprises are currently leveraging cloud computing to venture into new industries. Furthermore, 
74% of these businesses have embraced cloud technology to enhance their customer experience, 
while 71% utilize it to develop improved products and services, alongside the streamlining of 
legacy systems and cost reduction efforts.
Businesses must stay on top of current trends and use analytics to understand customer experience 
and apply that understanding to adapt their products and services based on what they learn.
Product lifecycles have shortened, and barriers to entry have become lower. Today's enablers for 
cloud growth, agility, and innovation include:
•	Artificial Intelligence, or AI
•	Automation
•	Internet of Things, or IoT
•	Blockchain
•	Applications that span new and legacy solutions
•	Open, hybrid, and secure multicloud infrastructures
The power, scalability, flexibility, and pay-as-you-go economics of cloud has made it the 
underpinning foundation for digital transformation.
The International Data Corporation, or IDC, predicts that by 2025, the total amount of digital data 
created worldwide will rise to 163 zettabytes (where one zettabyte is equivalent to a trillion 
gigabytes). And 30% of this data will be real-time information. Considering the unprecedented 
amounts of data being produced daily, and the ability to make data-driven decisions crucial to any 
business, cloud computing becomes essential for businesses to succeed, sustain, and compete in 
today's markets.
A cloud strategy, more than just an IT strategy, is the core component of any business strategy 
today. Businesses that haven't already, or are not currently, integrating cloud into their business 
strategy run the risk of lacking the speed, agility, innovation, and decision-making capacities needed 
to be competitive, as well as their ability to respond to digital disruption.

Key Cloud Service Providers and Their Services

Let's look at some numbers and predictions that help us see the scale, cloud is predicted
to achieve in the coming years.
Gartner predicts: The worldwide public cloud service market
to grow from $182.4 B in 2018 to $331.2 B in 2022, attaining
a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.6%.
Spending on Infrastructure-as-a-Service to increase from $30.5 B in 2018
to $76.6 B in 2022, growing 27.5% in a year.
Platform-as-a-Service spending to grow from $15.6 B in 2018 to $31.8B
2022, growing 21.8% in a year.
With software investments shifting from cloud-first to cloud-only, spending on Sofware-as-a-
Service is expected to grow from $80 B in 2018 to $143.7 B in 2022.
What is clear is that cloud is accelerating faster than predicted, adoption is high, and
revenues are soaring.
The question for businesses today is no longer "if" they need to adopt the cloud, rather
"what" their cloud adoption strategy should be to best serve their businesses and customers.
Keeping up with this technological wave, and driving it forward, are the Cloud Service
Providers with a wide range of services.
We will now talk about some of the major Cloud Service Providers in alphabetical order.

Overview of Cloud Service Models

In our introductory cloud video we briefly talked about the three service
models available on the cloud. Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service, and Software as a 
Service. Before we dive into the details of each of these service models in the subsequent videos, 
let's get started with a quick overview of these models.
Hi, I'm Tessa Rhodes, and I'm a designer on IBM Cloud. So let's start with the foundation here with 
IaaS. IaaS is a set of compute networking and storage resources that have been virtualized by a 
vendor so that a user can access and configure them any way they want. In design we have a 
concept of talking about users, called personas, and the persona for IaaS is a system admin, or an IT 
admin. Let's jump up to the top with Software as a Service that's the easy one. Software as a Service 
is just software that you don't have to install on your machine and you don't have to manually 
update.
And so the user for Software as a Service could be anyone. In fact, if you're watching this on 
YouTube right now, then you're a user of Software as a Service.
It's usually charged on a subscription model rather than a one-time license fee.
And that brings us to Platform as a Service. PaaS takes advantage of all the virtualized resources 
from Iaas and then just abstracts them away, so the user doesn't have to worry about managing any 
of those virtualized resources. The user for PaaS is not a system admin, usually. It's usually a dev.
In IBM we call this dev, Jane.
That's the name of our persona. And so this whole metaphor, the pyramid metaphor, is meant to 
indicate that as you move down, you're increasing complexity in terms of your knowledge and 
management of infrastructure resources and you're increasing the ease of use.
Another metaphor I use when I'm talking to the designers on my team about PaaS, is having to do 
with a car. So in this metaphor IaaS is like leasing a car. So if you've ever leased a car, you 
probably did a lot of research, and you care about the specs of the car and their performance. You 
care about the color of the car, what kind of car it is. You're the one driving and you're the one 
paying for it. You're also paying for the gas and any tolls or maintenance. With Platform as a 
Service in this metaphor, that's more like renting a car. So say you're on vacation and you just 
got off at the air Airport and you're going to pick up your rental car. You don't really care what color 
it is. You don't even care about the specs of it, but you're still driving and you're paying for the gas 
and any tolls you go through. Software as a Service is again the easiest one. That one's more like 
getting a taxi or an uber. So with the taxi or an uber, you don't care at all about what kind of car it 
is, what color it is and in fact, you're not even the one driving, or paying for gas, or any tolls 
because that's baked into the price. So let's see what it means in terms of cloud computing and its 
three service models. With IaaS, the cloud provider manages the physical resources, data 
centers, cooling power, Network and security, as well as computing resources that include 
servers and storage. With PaaS, the provider, in addition to the computing resources, also 
manages the platform infrastructure which includes the operating systems, development tools, 
databases, and business analytics. In the SaaS model, in addition to the infrastructure and the 
platform resources, the provider also hosts and manages the applications and data.
In the next video, we'll take a closer look at infrastructure-as-a-service its features, benefits, and 
some use cases.

Overview of Cloud Infrastructure
	
After choosing the cloud service model and the cloud type offered by vendors, customers
need to plan the infrastructure architecture.
The infrastructure layer is the foundation of the cloud.
This layer consists of physical resources that are housed in Regions, Zones and Data
Centers.
A Cloud provider's IT environment is typically distributed across many regions around the
world.
A cloud region, is a geographic area or location where a cloud provider's infrastructure
is clustered, and may have names like NA South or US East.
The cloud regions are isolated from each other so that if one region was impacted by a natural
disaster like an earthquake, the cloud operations in other regions would keep running.
Each Cloud Region can have multiple Zones (or Availability Zones or AZ for short), which
are typically distinct Data Centers with their own power, cooling and networking resources.
These Zones can have names like DAL-09 or us-east-1.
The isolation of zones improves the cloud's overall fault tolerance, decreases latency,
and avoids creating a single shared point of failure.
The Availability Zones (and DataCenters within them) are connected to other AZs and regions,
private datacenters and the Internet using very high bandwidth network connectivity.
A cloud data center is a huge room or a warehouse containing cloud infrastructure.
These data centers contain pods and racks or standardized containers of computing resources
such as servers, as well as storage, and networking equipment - virtually everything that a physical
IT environment has.
Computing Resources: Cloud providers offer several compute options
- Virtual Servers, Bare Metal Servers, and "Serverless" computing resources.
Most of the servers in a cloud datacenter run hypervisors to create virtual servers
or virtual machines (also called VMs for short), that are software-based computers, based on
virtualization technologies.
Other servers in the racks are bare metal servers that are physical servers that aren't
virtualized.
Customers can provision VMs and Bare Metals servers as and when they need them and run
their workloads on them.
Cloud users can also run their workloads on serverless computing resources, which are
an abstraction layer on top of virtual machines.
We will talk about all three compute options in greater detail in subsequent videos.
Storage: Information and data can consist of files,
code, documents, images, videos, backups, snapshots, and databases and can be stored
in many different types of storage options on the Cloud.
Bare Metal Servers and Virtual Servers are provisioned with default storage in local
drives.
Since these cloud servers can be provisioned and decommissioned by customers on demand
and freed up for use by other users, any information stored in a local drive can be lost when you
delete or decommission a cloud server.
However there are other storage options available on the cloud to persist data that you can
choose depending on factors like how important your data is, how quickly you want to be able
to access it, how often you access it, and how secure you need it to be.
These additional storage options include Block storage, File storage, and Object storage.
Block and file storage modes are commonly used in traditional data centers, but often
struggle with scale, performance and distributed characteristics of cloud.
Object storage is the most common mode of storage in the cloud as it's both highly
distributed and resilient.
We will examine Object Storage and the other storage options in more detail in later videos.
Networking: Networking infrastructure in a cloud data center
includes traditional networking hardware like routers and switches, but more importantly
for users of the Cloud, the Cloud providers have Software Defined Networking (or SDN)
options where certain networking resources are virtualized or made available programmatically,
through APIs.
This allows for easier network provisioning, configuration, and management in the cloud.
When servers in the cloud are provisioned, you need to setup their public and private
network interfaces.
The public network interfaces, as the name suggests, connect the servers to the public
internet, whereas the private ones provide connectivity to your other cloud resources
and help keep them secure.
As in the physical IT world, network interfaces in the cloud need to have IP addresses and
subnets either assigned automatically or configured.
In a cloud environment it is even more important to configure which network traffic and users
can access your resources, which can be done by setting up Security Groups and Access Control
Lists (or ACLs).
For further security and isolation of your resources in the cloud, most Cloud providers
provide Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs), Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), and Virtual
Private Networks (VPNs).
Some of the traditional hardware appliances such as firewalls, load balancers, gateways
and traffic analyzers can also be virtualized and made available as services in the cloud.
Another networking capability provided by the Cloud Providers is Content Delivery Networks
or CDNs, that distribute content to multiple points throughout the world so users accessing
the content can access it more quickly by getting it from a point nearest to them.
We will learn more about some of these cloud networking options and terminology in subsequent
videos.
Cloud infrastructure is constantly advancing and improving.
In the next video, we explain virtualization and virtual machines.

Virtualization and Virtual Machines Explained

Hi. My name is Kaleigh Bovey, with the IBM Cloud team and today we're going to be
talking about virtualization. As you know virtualization is a fairly old technology, but it's still super 
relevant to building our cloud computing strategy today.
So, first off, what is virtualization? Simply put, virtualization is the process of creating a software 
based, or virtual, version of something, whether that be compute, storage, networking, servers, or 
applications and what makes virtualization feasible, is something called the hypervisor.
We're going to write that here. What a hypervisor is, is it's simply a piece of software that runs 
above the physical server, or host. And there are a couple different types of hypervisors out there. 
What they do is essentially pull the resources from the physical server and allocate them to your 
virtual environments.
There are two main types of hypervisors out there. One being Type 1.
Very simple to remember. And 2, you guessed it, Type 2.
So let's start with Type 1. A Type 1 hypervisor is a hypervisor that is installed directly on top of the 
physical server. They're also called bare-metal hypervisors. So we'll write that up here. Remember 
these are the most frequently typed of use hypervisors and they're most secure, they lower the
latency, and these are the ones that you'll see in the market the most. Some examples would be 
VMware, ESXi, or Microsoft Hyper-v, or even open-source KVM. The other type of hypervisor is a 
Type 2 hypervisor, over here. And what makes these different is that there is a layer of host OS that 
sits between the physical server and the hypervisor. So, by that nature they are also called, Hosted.
These are a lot less frequent. They're mostly used for end-user virtualization and you might see 
some in the market that are called: Oracle, VirtualBox, or VMware Workstation. Again, they're a lot 
less frequent. They're a bit more...
They have a higher latency than a Type 1 hypervisor. So once you have your hypervisor installed, 
you can build virtual environments, or virtual machines, or simply put, VMs. So let's spin up some 
environments.
So, what makes a VM a VM? A VM is simply a software based computer. They're run like a 
physical computer. They have an operating system and applications, and they're completely 
independent of one another, but you can run multiple of them on a hypervisor and the hypervisor 
manages the resources that are allocated to these virtual environments from the physical server. So, 
because they're independent you can run different operating systems on different virtual machines. 
You could run Windows here, or Linux here, or UNIX here for example.
Because they're independent they're also extremely portable. You can move a virtual machine from 
one hypervisor to another hypervisor on a completely different machine almost instantaneously, 
which gives you a lot of flexibility and a lot of portability within your environment. So looking at
all of this - this is the core virtualization as a process. So let's talk about a couple key benefits that 
you want to take away from this.
1) Cost savings.
When you think about this and the fact that you can run multiple virtual environments from one 
piece of infrastructure, means that you can drastically reduce your physical infrastructure footprint. 
This is consolidation at its core. And the fact that you don't have to maintain nearly
as many servers, run as much electricity, save on maintenance costs, means that you
save on your bottom line at the end of the day.
2) Would be agility and speed. Like I said, spinning up a virtual machine is relatively easy and 
quick - a lot more simple than provisioning an entire new environment for your developers if they 
say they want to spin up a new environment so that they can run a test scenario. Whatever it might 
be, virtualization makes that process a lot simpler and quicker and
3) lowers your downtime.
So, let's say that this host goes out unexpectedly. The fact that you can move virtual machines from 
one hypervisor to another, on a different physical server, means that you have a great backup plan in 
place right? So, if this host goes down you can simply move your VMs very quickly to another 
hypervisor on a machine that is working. Virtualization and VMs are at the centre of cloud 
computing and provide many benefits. In the next video, we will discuss the types of virtual 
machines.

Reading: Types of Virtual Machines on Cloud

Virtual Machines or VMs are also known as virtual servers, virtual instances, or simply 
instances, depending on the cloud provider. Some popular cloud providers include IBM Cloud, 
AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. The various cloud providers make VMs available in a variety of 
configurations and deployment options to serve different use cases. Virtualization and VMs are at 
the center of cloud computing and provide many benefits.
When you create a virtual server in the cloud, specify the region and zone or data centre you want 
the server to be provisioned in and the operating system you want. You can choose between 
shared or multi-tenant VMs or dedicated, also known as single-tenant VMs. You can also 
choose between hourly or monthly billing and select storage and networking options for the 
virtual server. There are several different types of VMs that can be provisioned in the cloud.
Shared or Public Cloud VMs
Shared or Public Cloud VMs are provider-managed, multi-tenant deployments that can be 
provisioned on-demand with pre-defined sizes. Being multi-tenant means the underlying 
physical server is virtualized and shared across other tenants or users.
To satisfy different workloads, cloud providers offer pre-defined sizes and configurations 
ranging from a single virtual core and a small amount of RAM to multiple virtual cores and 
much larger amounts of RAM. For example, there can be configurations for:
•	Compute Intensive workloads
•	Memory-intensive workloads
•	High-Performance I/O
Rather than pick from only pre-defined sizes, some providers also offer custom configurations 
that allow users to define the number of cores and RAM and local storage characteristics.
Public VMs are usually priced by the hour (or, in some cases, even seconds), and 
configurations start as low as pennies per hour. Some providers also let you get monthly VMs, 
which can result in some cost savings if you know you will run the VM for at least a month, but if 
you decide to de-commission the VM in the middle of the month, you will still be charged for the 
full month.
Transient or Spot VMs
Transient or Spot VMs take advantage of unused capacity in a cloud data centre. Cloud 
providers make this unused capacity available to users at a much lower cost than regular VMs 
of similar sizes. Although the Transient VMs are available at a huge discount, the Cloud 
provider can choose to de-provision them at any time and reclaim the resources for 
provisioning regular, higher-priced VMs.
Because you run the risk of losing these VMs when capacity in the data centre decreases, these 
VMs are great for:
•	Non-production workloads such as testing and developing applications
•	Running stateless workloads
•	Testing scalability
•	Tunning big data and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads at a low cost
Reserved Virtual Server Instances
Reserved virtual server instances allow you to reserve capacity and guarantee resources for 
future deployments. You reserve the desired amount of virtual server capacity, provision instances 
from that capacity when you need them, and choose a term, such as 1 year or 3 years, for your 
reserved capacity. You're guaranteed this capacity within the data center of your choice for the 
life of the contract term. By committing to a longer term, you can also lower your costs compared 
to hourly or monthly instances. This can be useful when you know you require at least a certain 
level of cloud capacity for a specific duration.
If you exceed your reserved capacity, you can always choose to supplement your unplanned 
usage and capacity requirements with hourly or monthly VMs. However, not all pre-defined 
VMs families or configurations may be available as reserved.
Dedicated Hosts
Dedicated hosts offer single-tenant isolation. This means that only your VMs run on a given host 
so that they can make exclusive use of the full capacity and resources of the underlying 
hardware.
When provisioning a dedicated host, you must specify the data center and POD in which you 
want your host placed. You then assign instances, or virtual machines, to a specific host. This 
allows for maximum control over workload placement. Dedicated hosts are typically used for 
meeting compliance and regulatory requirements or meeting specific licensing terms.

Basics of Storage on Cloud

Cloud storage is where you save data and files in the cloud.
Certain storage must be attached to a compute node before the storage can be accessed, whereas
other storage types can be directly accessed either through the public Internet or a dedicated
private network connection.
Cloud providers host, secure, manage, and maintain the cloud storage and associated infrastructure 
to ensure you have access to your data when you need it.
Cloud storage services allow you to scale your capacity as you need so you only pay for what you 
provision, usually on a 'per gigabyte' basis.
The cost of storage will vary by type but in general, the faster the read / write speed of the storage, 
the higher the per gigabyte cost.
Cloud storage is available in four main types - Direct Attached, File Storage, Block Storage and 
Object Storage.
Direct Attached storage, sometimes referred to as 'Local Storage', is storage which is presented 
directly to a cloud-based server and is effectively either within the host server chassis or within the 
same rack.
This storage is fast and normally only used to store a server's operating system, although it can have 
other use cases. The main two reasons why direct attached storage is not so great for other uses 
besides to store the operating system is that it's typically 'Ephemeral' , meaning that it only lasts as 
long at the compute resource it's attached to - it cannot be shared with other nodes and while you 
can use RAID techniques, it's not as resilient to failure as other types of storage.
File storage is typically presented to compute nodes as 'NFS Storage'.
NFS stands for Network File System and means that the storage is connected to compute nodes
over a standard ethernet network.
NFS-mounted storage is common-place but it tends to be slower than either direct-attached
storage or block storage because the data travels over an ethernet network.
It also tends to be lower cost than either direct attached or block storage.
One advantage of File Storage is that it can be mounted or used on multiple servers at
once.
File-based storage is a simple, straightforward approach to data storage and works well for
organizing data in a hierarchical folder structure, that desktop users are familiar with.
Block storage is presented to compute nodes using high-speed fibre connections, which
means that read and write speeds are typically much faster and reliable than with file storage,
making block storage suitable for use with databases and other applications where disk
speed is important.
You typically provision block storage in 'volumes', which can then be mounted onto a compute 
node, which it then effectively sees as another hard drive.
Volumes can normally only be mounted onto one compute node at a time.
With both File and Block storage, you may also hear the term 'IOPS'.
IOPS stands for 'Input/Output Operations Per Second' and relates to the speed of the storage or 
to put it another way, how quickly data can be read from or written to the storage.
We'll cover this in a little more detail in a later video.
Persistence is a term that is used when provisioning File or Block storage and relates to what
happens to the storage once the compute node it is attached to is terminated.
If the storage is set to 'persist' then it will not be deleted along with the compute node, meaning that 
it and its data are preserved and available to mount onto another compute node, though you will 
continue to pay for the storage.
You can also, in some cases, set the storage so that it is automatically deleted with the compute 
node that it is mounted onto - in this case, as we know, it becomes Ephemeral Storage.
Here, you will also stop paying for the storage but you will lose any data unless it is backed
up somewhere.
There are several ways to backup data in the cloud but one way to back up both File and
Block storage is to take a Snapshot.
As the term implies, this is a point in time image of the storage.
Snapshots are usually fast to create (they don't actually write any data, or rather they create 
metadata), don't require downtime and subsequent snapshots record only changes to the data.
They are great for returning storage to the way it was at a particular snapshot, though note, they 
cannot be used to recover individual files.
The fourth kind of storage is Object storage.
This is a different type of storage in so much as it's not attached to a compute node, rather it is 
accessed via an API.
Of all the storage types, Object Storage is by far the cheapest and also the slowest in terms of read 
and write speeds, but it is infinite in size to the end user.
Unlike File and Block storage where you provision a certain storage capacity and it fills up over 
time, with Object Storage you can keep adding files to it and it never fills up, you just pay for what 
you use.
This makes Object Storage a fantastic repository for all sorts of unstructured data types,
large and small, including documents, video, logs, backups, data from IoT, application 
binaries and virtual machine images.
In the following videos, there will be more detailed information on the different types
of storage.

Lesson Summary: Introduction to Cloud 
Computing and Cloud Infrastructure
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	Five essential characteristics of cloud computing are on-demand self-service, broad 
network access, resource pooling, elasticity, and measured service.
•	Some of the benefits of cloud computing are power, scalability, and flexibility.
•	Cloud provider services include computing, network, storage, security, monitoring, 
managing, communication, analytics, data migration, and web hosting.
•	The infrastructure as a service (IaaS) model provides the hardware, such as computing, 
networking, and storage. Platform as a service (PaaS) offers IaaS plus the platform 
infrastructure, which includes operating systems, development tools, databases, and business 
analytics. In the software-as-a-service model, the ISP provides all that PaaS does, plus 
hosting and managing applications and their data.
•	Basic cloud infrastructure includes physical resources that are housed in regions 
(geographic locations), zones (multiple data centers in a zone), and data centers 
(multiple machines in a data center). The machines have storage and may consist of bare 
metal servers or virtual servers. An organization's machines communicate using virtual local 
area networks, virtual private clouds, and virtual private networks. Appliances include 
firewalls, load balancers, and gateways.
•	Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based or virtual version of 
something, whether that be a computer, storage, networking, servers, or applications 
using a piece of software that runs above the physical server. The software essentially 
pulls the resources from the physical server and allocates them to virtual environments.
•	The four types of cloud storage are attached, file storage, block storage, and object 
storage. The attached storage hosts a server's operating system and is fast. File storage, or 
network file system (NFS), is slower than attached or block storage but is also cheaper than 
they are. Block storage is fast, reliable, and suitable for databases and applications where 
disk speed is important. Object storage is cheap but has the slowest read/write speed.


Emergent Trends and Practices in cloud 
Computing
Hybrid Multi-cloud

Hybrid Cloud, as we covered in the previous lesson, is a computing environment that connects and 
organizations on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud into a single infrastructure for 
running the organization's applications.
Multicloud is a cloud adoption strategy that embraces a mix of cloud models from different service 
providers - public, private, and managed, across infrastructure, platform, or software services.
For example, a business may consume email as a service from one provider, a CRM application 
from another, and infrastructure from yet another provider. So, essentially, a Hybrid Multi-cloud 
implies you're able to leverage the best of cloud models and services across different service 
providers, and have your applications and workloads working seamlessly across multiple 
different clouds. In this video we will look at some use cases for why a business may want to use a 
hybrid multi- cloud approach. In this video I want to touch on a few of those use cases for
why a business may want to use hybrid or multicloud. Let's start with the basic one: cloud scaling. 
Now most of us are probably familiar with this, it's one of the main reasons for adopting the cloud.
Now let's say we have a flower delivery service that is able to hit a certain bottom line of users to 
have on-premise infrastructure, and it can hit a certain amount of user load. So, visualizing this
here throughout a calendar year, you can imagine that their load maybe goes up and down, and 
responds to specific holidays. Now to hit those peaks, they could scale up their on-premise  
architecture, but that's met with upfront costs and cost of upkeep. Now instead what they'll do, is 
take advantage of cloud that allows them to scale up in response to that load, and then automatically 
deprovision resources when they no longer need them. Now, this concept is kind of general to cloud 
computing, not just hybrid or multicloud. That brings me to my next topic. Here we're gonna be 
talking about how it can be used to build a composite cloud.
Essentially this is going to be applications that are spread across multiple cloud environments. So 
back to the flower delivery service. Let's say they have on-premise architecture that allows them to 
run three major components of their app. So, let's say they have the web UI. They have some
billing API's, as well as a rewards framework. Now let's say that this service is actually based in 
EU, and their European customers are happy. But for their North American or American
customers, it's best specifically around, you know, Veterans Day or Thanksgiving,
they're noticing that the system is bogging down. So they decide to take advantage of a hybrid cloud 
or multi- cloud architecture by composing their application across multiple cloud environments. So, 
they'll take advantage of data centers in America, and essentially, they've identified that
although the rewards framework can stay on Prem in their European side, they want to move the 
billing and the UI capabilities over. So they'll move just those two to a cloud platform of their
choice in a North American or American datacenter. This kinda allows them to scale up portions in 
response to say American holidays, while keeping their EU portions individually scaled. So in this
example the flower delivery service is able to take advantage of scaling at a global level by using 
the hybrid or multicloud architecture. Next let's talk about the airline or travel industry.
So we can first start with an example of modernization.
In the past we've seen that reservation systems may have been difficult to work with, or you might 
have had to call in. But almost all the airline companies now have a mobile application. So most of 
the time, and we've actually found that, it's about - in general - not just in the travel industry,
but 80% of all enterprise applications are actually still on Prem. And that's likely the case in this 
industry as well.
So, in this specific example, let's say they have a reservation system that's running on prem. But to 
create new experiences for their end-users, let's say they've created a mobile application.
That mobile app, of course, has a mobile backend that's maybe running in a public cloud. And that 
in turn works with the reservation service. So again, the mobile app can hit the mobile backend, that 
in turn works with the reservation capabilities. In this case, they've modernized and
new user experiences are possible. But let's take that a step further. Now a source for a lot of 
dissatisfaction for users, is whenever their flights are delayed - so when a flight is delayed, they
may have to rebook new flights. The solution is almost always the same. The traveler wants to get 
to his destination in the easiest way possible. What airline industries have been doing is taking 
advantage of the cloud to create maybe a recommendation feature. It allows them to book new 
flights as soon as the delay is recommended, or as soon as the delay is incurred and that's
going to connect up to that mobile backend service, allowing users to be able to book flights 
through their phone the second of flight is delayed. This not only improves the bottom line for the
airline industry, it leads to happier users.
That's one way the modernization has been done. Next, let's take it even a step further and talk 
about data and AI.
For data and AI, the airline industry has been taking advantage of lots of historical data. Over the 
decades that a company has been around, let's say they have historical data of when unplanned
maintenance has happened on their airline. In fact, 30% of all delay time in the airline industry is 
actually when unplanned maintenance happens. So by taking advantage of, let's say, machine
learning or AI capabilities, they could hook into all of the legacy data that they have - large volumes 
- and connect them up to machine learning and AI capabilities. This allows airline
industries to take advantage of predictive analytics and get insights before errors, or before the 
unplanned maintenance ever occurs. This again improves their bottom line, leading to
happier users and a more efficient airline industry. Today we talked about four major use cases for 
hybrid and multicloud platforms: cloud scaling and composite cloud, in the flower delivery service, 
as well as modernize in data and AI for the airline industry. Another reason for adopting hybrid 
multicloud strategy is to prevent lock-in to a specific vendor's cloud platform and having flexibility 
of being able to move workloads from one cloud platform to another as the need arises. In the next 
video, we will understand what a microservices architecture is, its features, benefits, and use cases.


Containers

Containers are an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along
with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere, whether
it be on desktop, traditional IT, or the cloud.
Containers are small, fast, and portable, and unlike virtual machines, they do not need
to include a guest OS in every instance and can, instead, simply leverage the features
and resources of the host OS.
In the rest of this video, we will see how container-based technology really works.
Hi everyone.
My name is Sai Vennam and I'm a developer advocate with IBM.Today I want to talk about
containerization.
Whenever I mention containers, most people tend to default to something like Docker or
even Kubernetes these days.
But container technology has actually been around for quite some time.
It's actually back in 2008 that the Linux kernel introduced C groups, and control groups,
that basically paved the way for all the different container technologies we see today.
So that includes Docker, but also things like Cloud Foundry, as well as Rocket and other
container runtimes out there.
Let's get started with an example, and we'll say that I was a developer.
I've created a node.js application and I want to push it into production.
We'll take two different form factors to kind of explain the advantages of containerization.
Let's say that first we'll talk about VMs, and then we'll talk about containers.
So, first things first, let's introduce some of the things that we've got here.
We've got the hardware itself, just a big box.
We've got the guest, or rather, the host, operating system, as well as a hypervisor.
Hypervisor is actually what allows us to spin up VMs.
Let's take a look at this shared pool of resources with the host OS and hypervisor.
We can assume that some of these resources have already been consumed.
Next, let's go ahead and take this .js application and push it in.
And to do that, I need a Linux VM. So let's go ahead and sketch out that Linux VM.
In this VM there's a few things to note here.
So, we've got another operating system, in addition to the host OS, it's gonna be the guest OS,
as well as some binaries and libraries.
That's one of the things about Linux VMs, that even though we're working with a really
lightweight application, to create that Linux VM, we have to put that guest OS in there,
in a set of binaries and libraries.
That really bloats it out.
In fact, you know, I think the smallest node .js VM that I've seen out there is 400 plus mega
bytes, whereas the node.js runtime and app itself would be under 15.
So we've got that and we'll go ahead and let's push that .js application into it.
Just by doing that alone, we're gonna consume a set of resources.
Next, let's think about scaling this out. Right.
So we'll create two additional copies of it, and you'll notice that even though it's the
exact same application, we have to use and deploy that separate guest OS and libraries
every time.
And so we'll do that three times.
And by doing that, essentially, we can assume that for this particular hardware we've consumed
all of the all of the resources.
And there's another thing that I haven't mentioned here, but this .js application, I developed
it on my macbook.
So when I pushed it into production to get it going on the VM, and notice that there were some 
issues and incompatibilities.
This is the kind of foundations is big, he said, she said issue.
Where things might be working on your local machine, and work great, but when you try
to push it into production, things start to break.
and this really gets in the way of doing agile DevOps, and continuous integration and delivery.
That's solved when you use something like containers.
There's a three-step process when kind of doing anything container related, and then pushing, or 
creating, containers.
And it almost always starts with first, some sort of a manifest.
So something that describes the container itself.
So in the Docker world, this would be something like a Docker file
and in Cloud Foundry, this would be a manifest Channel.
Next, what you'll do is create the actual image itself.
So for the image, again, if you're working with something like Docker, that could be something
like a Docker image.
If you're working with Rocket it would be an ACI or application container image.
So regardless of the different containerization technologies, this process stays the same.
The last thing you end up with is an actual container itself.
You know, that contains all of the runtimes, and libraries, and binaries needed to run an application.
That application runs on a very similar set up to the VMS, but what we've got on this side is, again, 
a host operating system.
The difference here, instead of a hypervisor, we're gonna have something like a runtime engine.
So if you're using Docker this would be the Docker engine and, you know, different 
containerization
technologies would have a different engine.
Regardless, it's something that runs those containers.
Again, we've got this shared pool of resources, so we can assume that that alone consumes
some set of resources.
Next, let's think about actually containerizing this technology.
We talked about the three-step process.
We create a docker file.
We build out the image.
We push it to a registry, and we have our container and we can start pushing this out
as containers.
The great thing is, these are going to be much more lightweight.
So deploying out multiple containers, since you don't have to worry about a guest OS this
time, you really just have the libraries, as well as the the application itself.
So we've scaled that out three times, and because we don't have to duplicate all of those operating
system dependencies and create bloated VMs, we actually will use less resources.
So use a different color here... and scaling that out three times, we still have a good
amount of resources left.
Next, let's say that my coworker decides, hey, for this .js application, let's take
advantage of a third party you know let's say a cognitive API - to do something like image 
recognition.
Let's say that we've got our third party service, and we want to access that using maybe a Python
application.
So he's created that service that acts as that third party APIs and with our node.js application, we 
want to access that Python app, to then access that service.
If we wanted to do this in VMs, I'm really tempted to basically create a VM out of both the .js 
application and the Python application because essentially that would allow me to continue to use 
the VMs that I have.
But that's not truly cloud native, right?
Because if I wanted to scale out the .js, but not the Python app, I wouldn't be able to if they were 
running in the same VM.
So to do it in a truly cloud native way, essentially I would have to free up some of these resources.
Basically get rid of one of these VMs, and then deploy the Python application in it instead.
And you know, that's not ideal.
But with the container based approach what we can do is simply say, since we're modular, we can 
say, okay, just deploy one copy of the Python application.
So we'll go ahead and do that.
There's a different color here.
And that consumes a little bit more resources and then with those those remaining resources, the 
great thing about container technology, that actually becomes shared between all the processes 
running.
In fact, another advantage if some of these container processes aren't actually utilizing
the CPU or memory, all of those shared resources become accessible for the other containers
running within that hardware.
So with container-based technology, we can truly take advantage of cloud native based
architectures.
We talked about things like portability of the containers.
We talked about how it's easier to scale them out.
And then overall, with this kind of three-step process and the way we push containers, allows
for more agile devops and continuous integration and delivery.
Containers streamline development and deployment of Cloud Native applications.
In the next lesson, we will cover cloud storage.

Microservices

Microservices architecture is an approach in which a single application is composed
of many loosely coupled and independently deployable, smaller components or services.
These services typically have their own stack running on their own containers.
They communicate with one another over a combination of APIs, event streaming, and message 
brokers.
For a business, what this means is that: Application components can be developed and updated 
more efficiently by multiple developers working independently.
Teams can use different stacks and runtime environments for different components.
Components facing too much load can be scaled independently, reducing the waste and cost
associated with having to scale entire applications.
In this video, we'll look at how microservices have shaped application development, and also
look at a use case that illustrates microservices in action.
The way developers work to build applications is changing.
In the past, software was built as large monolithic applications where a team of developers would
take months to construct a large application built on a common code base.
These developers would write every part of the application from start to finish.
Now, after decades of software development, there are vast amounts of code already out
there that developers can use as the base of an application, meaning they no longer
have to create every line of code from scratch.
Cloud development platforms provide developers with an ecosystem of code that can be easily
and securely integrated into applications.
Now, instead of building one huge application on one team, developers break into small 
independent teams where they write smaller amounts of code called microservices.
Microservices breakdown large applications into their core functions, for example, search,
recommendations, customer ratings, or product catalogs.
Each is developed independently of one another, yet work together on the cloud development
platform to create a functioning application.
A container is the distribution method for each microservice, meaning it delivers the
code where it needs to go.
Containers are plug-and-play, so if one microservice isn't working for an application, developers
can take it out and put in a different one without disrupting how the rest of the app
functions.
Check out microservices in action with Ron.
Ron is a soccer fan who uses an online streaming media service called Dream Game.
Last night he missed watching his team play their crucial semi-final match.
Luckily, he can watch the game tonight with Dream Game.
When he logs in, he sees the most popular content among all Dream Game users.
After some searching, he finds the match he's looking for.
What he would really like is to find his game with one click.
Luckily, the Dream Game development team is using microservices to develop a better user
experience for viewers like Ron.
The first microservice is a content catalog housing the millions of games that Dream Game
offers.
The small team of developers organizes each piece of content with metadata that describes
them.
This metadata feeds into a second microservice, the search function, which ensures that Ron's
search results are captured and compared to the Dream Game catalog.
The third microservice, recommendations, captures data about the most popular content among
all Dream Game users.
This is what generates the home page that Ron saw when he first logged in.
These three microservices are all in their separate containers ready to join the application.
But before they can work together, they have to find one another.
They do this by using something called service discovery, which creates a roadmap for these
and many other microservices to communicate.
When microservices find each other, they communicate using an application programming interface
or an API.
So when Ron searches for his favorite soccer team, the search microservice is communicating
to the content catalog, in an API, about what Ron is looking for.
Now back to the goal at hand.
To get Ron to a soccer game with just one click, the development team working on the
recommendations microservice is updating the code, adding an analytics algorithm.
Using analytics, the recommendations microservice will compare Ron's viewing history and 
preferences
to popular content among other users, including soccer fans and viewers in Ron's geographical
region and demographic.
Since the developers didn't need to create the code from scratch, they are able to deploy
this new functionality in a matter of days.
These updates happen behind the scenes as the rest of the microservice containers function
normally.
The next time Ron checks DreamGame, instead of just seeing the most popular or newest
content he sees a personalized playlist that will continue to refine itself as the system
learns more about his viewing habits and preferences.
The result, Ron finds his favorite team's latest game right away.
The microservice approach lets developers quickly innovate applications in parallel
and lets users like Ron focus on the things that really interest them.
And when those interests are changing and growing faster every day, microservices help
businesses keep up and grow with their customers.
In the next video, we will talk about serverless computing, its features, benefits, and some
use cases.

Serverless Computing

Serverless is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure
management tasks such as scaling, scheduling, patching, and provisioning application stacks
to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on the code and
business logic specific to their applications or process.
Serverless doesn't mean there are no servers; only that the management of the underlying
physical or virtual servers is removed from their users.
The serverless computing environment allocates resources as needed for the applications.
Let's look at some key attributes that distinguish serverless computing from other compute models.
The serverless model requires no provisioning of servers, installation of application stacks and 
software, or operation of the infrastructure by the developer.
Serverless computing runs code only on-demand on a per-request basis, scaling transparently
with the number of requests being served.
Serverless enables end users to pay only for resources being used, never paying for idle capacity, 
which is unlike virtual servers on the cloud-where end users pay for VMs as long as they are 
running even if idle.
Effectively, serverless abstracts the infrastructure away from developers.
Code is executed as individual functions where each function runs inside a stateless container.
No prior execution context is required to serve a request; and with each new request, a new instance 
of the function is invoked.
Let's look at a scenario.
You could, for example, have a serverless platform between the front-end of your website
and your storage layer, running individual functions.
The serverless app could be translating text files and storing it in a cloud-based storage service.
Using the front-end of your website, you send text files to a serverless app. The app creates
translations in different languages, and then stores these translated files in cloud storage,
bjectand sends their links back to you.
Some of the key serverless computing services today include IBM Cloud Functions (which is
based on Apache OpenWhisk), AWS Lamb-da, and Microsoft Azure Functions.
It is important to note that serverless may not be the best fit for all applications or scenarios.
You need to evaluate application characteristics and ensure that the application is aligned
to serverless architecture patterns.
Applications that qualify for a serverless architecture include some of the following characteristics: 
Short-running stateless functions (seconds or minutes).
Seasonal workloads with varying off-peak and peaks.
Production volumetric data that shows too much idle time.
Event-based processing or asynchronous request processing for implementing use cases.
Microservices that can be built as functions that are stateless.
Serverless architectures are well-suited for use cases around data and event processing, IoT, 
microservices, and mobile backends.
Given its inherent and automatic scaling, rapid provisioning, and a pricing model that does not 
charge for idle time, supporting microservices architecture has become one of the most common use 
cases of serverless computing today.
Serverless is well-suited to working with structured text, audio, image, and video data around tasks 
such as data enrichment, transformation, validation and cleansing, PDF processing, audio 
normalization, thumbnail generation, and video transcoding.
Parallel tasks such as data search and processing, and genome processing, are also well-suited
to be run on a serverless runtime.
Serverless is also well-suited for working with all sorts of data stream ingestions, including business 
data streams, IoT sensor data, log data, and financial market data.
And finally, let's look at some challenges worth considering about serverless.
Serverless workloads are designed to scale up and down in response to workload, but for workloads 
characterized by long-running processes managing a traditional server environment might be 
simpler and more cost-effective.
The serverless application architecture can be vendor dependent, and so there is a potential for 
vendor lock-in, particularly involving platform capabilities such as authentication, scaling, 
monitoring, or configuration management.
Because serverless architectures scale up and down in response to workload, they also sometimes 
need to start up from zero to serve a new request. Serverless is an approach to computing that 
offloads responsibility for common infrastructure
management tasks such as scaling, scheduling, patching, and provisioning application stacks

For certain applications, this delay isn't much of an impact, but for something like a low-latency 
financial application, this delay wouldn't be acceptable.

Cloud Native Applications

Simply put, a cloud native application is an application developed from the outset to
work only in the cloud environment, or an existing app that has been refactored and
reconfigured with cloud native principles.
A cloud native application consists of microservices working together as a whole to comprise an
application, yet each can be independently scaled and iterated through automation and
orchestration processes.
These microservices are often packaged in containers, which are executable units of
software in which the application code is packaged along with its libraries and dependencies
so that it can be run anywhere.
This independence enables frequent, iterative improvement of cloud native applications,
without disrupting the experience of end-users.
Cloud native applications are unlike traditional, or monolithic applications, that are built
out of one huge piece of software; applications that tightly couple the user interface, business-logic
layer, and data-layer.
Let's take the example of how a cloud native application might be used on a travel website.
Each topic covered by the site-flights, hotels, cars, specials-is its own microservice.
Each microservice may roll out new features independent of the other microservices.
Specials and discounts can also scale out independently.
While the travel site is presented to customers as a whole, each microservice remains independent
and can be scaled or updated as needed without affecting other services.
Whether creating a new cloud native application or modernizing an existing application, developers
adhere to a consistent set of development principles:
Follow the microservices architectural approach by breaking applications down to single-function
microservices.
Rely on containers for maximum flexibility, scalability, and portability.
Adopt Agile methods that speed the creation and improvement process through quick iterative
updates based on user feedback.
In this video, we'll take a closer look at the key concepts of cloud native, its benefits,
and use cases.
Hi.
I'm Andrea Crawford and I'm with IBM Cloud.
Today we're going to talk about cloud native apps.
In the heritage world, we have our lumpy, monolithic apps.
And in the new world, we have our microservices living on the cloud.
If we take a look at this diagram here, we see we have cloud infrastructure.
This is your private, your public, and your enterprise infrastructure.
Cloud native apps apply to hybrid and multicloud situations.
We also have our scheduling and orchestration layer.
This layer is all about control planes, like our kubernetes.
We also have our application and data services layer.
This layer is all about backing services, and being able to integrate our application
code with existing services that may be available on other clouds, or even on-premise.
We have our application runtimes, these are what we're traditionally, or conventionally,
known as middleware.
And over here, well, that's where we have our
cloud native apps.
This is the sweet spot right up here.
So our application code is actually designed, built, and delivered very differently for
cloud native, than it would be for conventional, monolithic, lumpy apps over here.
Let's talk a little bit about why cloud native apps
can actually leverage benefits like: enabling innovation,
business agility, and most importantly - from a commoditization of this solution stack over
here.
So as time has progressed and technologies have matured and emerged, a lot of the services
are actually being refactored lower down in this stack.
This means that core services are starting to have a lower center of gravity, freeing
up innovation at this level over here.
So, what are our use cases for when to build a cloud native app?
*Everything*
Everything that lives in the cloud should have a cloud native app design and approach.
This means our application code needs to be instrumented with things like: standardized
logging, standardized events, and being able to match those logging and events to a
standard catalog, that multiple microservices and cloud native apps can use.
The last thing we want to do is have our development squads have to figure out what their log and
event messages should be.
Let's standardize that, because we want to be able to commoditize that as well.
We also need to have things like distributed tracing.
When we get over into the microservices world over here, we have a lot of moving parts.
This means we're going to need to leverage services core to the system, like: load balancing,
service discovery, and routing.
These are the kinds of things that are commoditized in this layer here, with things like Istio, and 
with the emergence of newer projects, like Knative.
And so, if we were to recognize the benefits for cloud native apps and to sum it all up,
we are all about enterprise and engineering at scale.
In the next video we'll take a look at DevOps.

DevOps on the Cloud

Development teams need to design, develop, deliver and run software as reliably and efficiently
as possible.
Operations teams need to identify and resolve problems as soon as possible by monitoring,
predicting failure, managing the environment, and fixing issues.
Combining development and operations with the ability to monitor and analyze and optimize
bottlenecks gives us DevOps, a collaborative approach where business owners and the 
development, operations, and quality assurance teams collaborate to continuously deliver software.
A DevOps approach applies agile and lean thinking principles to all stakeholders in an organization
who develop, operate, or benefit from the business's software systems, including customers,
suppliers, partners.
By extending lean principles across the software supply chain, DevOps capabilities improve
productivity through accelerated customer feedback cycles, unified measurements and
collaboration across an enterprise, and reduced overhead, duplication, and rework.
Using the DevOps approach, developers can produce software in short iterations on a continuous 
delivery schedule of new features and bug fixes in rapid cycles; and businesses can seize market 
opportunities and reduce time to include customer feedback in their products.
The DevOps process involves: Continuous Delivery, which is about delivering small, well-
designed, high-quality, increments of software to customers.
Continuous Integration; creating packaged builds of the code changes released as immutable
images; where immutable implies that when modifications are needed, the entire component
is replaced with an upgraded version.
Continuous Deployment, which involves progressing each new packaged build through the 
deployment lifecycle as rapidly as possible.
Continuous Monitoring; with tools that help developers understand the performance and
availability of their applications, even before they are deployed to production.
Delivery Pipeline; which is an automated sequence of steps that involves the stages of
Ideation, Coding, Building, Deploying, Managing, and Continuous Improvement; which loops back
to the Ideation phase in the delivery pipeline.
While DevOps can apply to applications anywhere, there is especially a compelling case for 
DevOps when it comes to cloud-ready, and cloud-native applications.
DevOps and Cloud share a symbiotic relationship.
With its near limitless compute power and available data and application services, cloud
computing platforms come with their own risks and challenges.
DevOps' tools, practices, and processes are helping tackle some of the complexities
and challenges posed by the cloud and allowing solutions to be delivered-quickly and reliably.
Let's look at some core capabilities that DevOps provides to help building and running
applications in the cloud a lot more manageable: DevOps best practices make it possible to
programmatically provision servers, build middleware, install application code, and
fully automate the installation process in a way that is documented, repeatable, verifiable,
and traceable.
Application deployments often involve considerable complexity.
The DevOps' practices of continuous integration and continuous deployment help create a fully
automated deployment pipeline, which is important all through the application development 
lifecycle.
Cloud native applications form a complex distributed system with multiple moving parts, 
independent
tech stacks, and rapid release cycles.
DevOps principles are essential to define how people work together to build, deploy,
and manage applications in a cloud native approach.
With the DevOps best practices of automated provisioning and continuous deployment, developers,
quality professionals, and other stakeholders can test in low-cost, production-like test
environments that were previously not available-enhancing both productivity and quality.
When systems are compromised or struggling to recover from natural disasters, DevOps
best practices make it possible to rebuild these systems quickly and reliably.
DevOps provides a powerful set of principles, practices, and tools to realize the full potential
of cloud-native computing, as well as for modernizing existing applications to leverage
cloud benefits.
In the next video, we'll learn about application modernization.

Reading: IoT, AI, Blockchain, and Analytics in 
the Cloud
In this new era, technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, 
and blockchain disrupt existing business models and industries while creating unprecedented 
opportunities for businesses to differentiate themselves and create value for their clients. The power, 
scale, dynamic nature, and economics of cloud resources make cloud computing a key enabler for 
adopting and evolving these emerging technologies.
IoT
The Internet of Things, or IoT, powered by the cloud, is making a big difference for businesses 
today. The IoT is a giant network of connected things and people that have changed much of how 
we live our daily lives - from how we drive to how we make purchases, monitor our personal 
health, and even how we get energy for our homes.
Smart devices and sensors are continuously tracking and collecting data. For example, a smart 
building could have thousands of sensors measuring all kinds of data related to thermal, optical, 
structural, and environmental stimuli. An unprecedented amount of data is being generated, putting 
a tremendous strain on the Internet. That is where the cloud comes in. By connecting the IoT device 
user to the cloud - be it for device registration, device identity, storing data, or accessing enterprise 
data.
Data collected through IoT devices is stored and processed on the cloud. Since IoT devices can be 
in motion, the cloud serves as a collection point in the closest proximity, minimizing the latency in 
reporting the data points and providing a response to the IoT application. So, from IOT platforms 
running entirely on the cloud to the interfaces used by customers to interact with these devices to 
the backend analytics platforms - cloud computing supports and enables IoT.
Cloud service providers also offer specialized IoT services designed to help speed up the 
development of IoT solutions.
AI
Making sense of the endless data streams is where artificial intelligence, or AI, comes in. Many of 
the applications where we apply AI today wouldn't have been possible without the scalable, on-
demand computing offered by the cloud.
There is a three-way relationship between AI, IoT, and Cloud. Just as AI consumes the data 
produced by IoT devices, the IoT devices' behavior can be dictated based on responses from AI. For 
example, Smart Assistants, a common type of IoT device, continue to learn about the user's 
preferences as usage grows, such as the songs they like, their home temperature settings, and 
preferred mealtimes, and over time they anticipate their actions based on the user's history. So, what 
we see is a symbiotic relationship between IoT, AI, and Cloud. IoT delivers the data, AI powers the 
insights, and these emerging technologies leverage the cloud's scalability and processing power to 
provide value to individuals and businesses.
Blockchains
Blockchain is a secure, distributed, open technology that can help speed up processes, lower costs, 
and build transparency and traceability in transactional applications. It is an immutable network 
allowing members to view only those transactions that are relevant to them. The more open, 
diverse, and distributed the network, the stronger the trust and transparency in the data and 
transactions.
85% of businesses today rely on multiple clouds to meet their IT needs, with more than 70% using 
more than three. These businesses must be able to move applications and data across multiple 
clouds easily and securely, leading to the emerging demand to build and manage business 
applications such as blockchain for the multi-cloud environment.
Blockchain and AI, much like IoT and AI powered by the cloud, also have a three-way 
relationship. Where blockchain technology provides the trusted, decentralized source of truth, 
AI powers the analytics and decision-making from the data collected, and the cloud offers 
globally distributed, scalable, and cost-efficient computing resources to support both the 
unprecedented amounts of data being collected and the processing power required to draw 
insights from this data. The blockchain makes AI more understandable by recording the data and 
variables that go into a decision made in an AI algorithm, leading to greater trust and transparency 
in the conclusions and decisions made by these algorithms.
Analytics on Cloud
Cloud analytics technologies leverage the flexibility, scalability, and computing resources available. 
From tracking trends on social media to predicting future events to analyzing data to build machine 
learning models that can be deployed in cognitive applications, the cloud provides the integrated 
environment required to leverage data for continuous improvement and accelerated business 
growth.

Lesson Summary: Emergent Trends and Practices 
in Cloud Computing
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	The hybrid multi-cloud is a cloud adoption strategy that embraces a mix of cloud models 
from different service providers - public, private, and managed, across infrastructure, 
platforms, or software services.
•	Explain how containers help with cloud-native applications.
•	Microservices is an architecture in which a single application is composed of many loosely 
coupled and independently deployable, smaller components or services. These services 
typically have their stack running on their containers. They communicate over APIs, event 
streaming, and message brokers.
•	The serverless model requires no provisioning of servers, installation of application stacks 
and software, or operation of the infrastructure by the developer. Serverless computing runs 
code only on-demand, on a per-request basis, scaling transparently with the number of 
requests served. Serverless enables end users to pay only for resources being used, never 
paying for idle capacity, which is unlike virtual servers on the cloud-where end users pay 
for VMs as long as they are running, even if idle.
•	A cloud-native application consists of multiple microservices working together to comprise 
an application, yet each can be independently scaled and iterated through automation and 
orchestration processes. The cloud-native architecture enables frequent, iterative 
improvement of cloud-native applications without disrupting the end-user's experience. 
Cloud-native applications are unlike traditional or monolithic applications, which are built 
out of one huge piece of software. Monolithic applications tightly couple the user interface, 
business logic, and data layers.

Introduction to Troubleshooting

Welcome to "Introduction to Troubleshooting."
After watching this video, you will be able to define troubleshooting, explain the CompTIA 
troubleshooting model.
Troubleshooting is a systematic approach to problem-solving that is often used to find
and correct issues with computers.
Troubleshooting is a significant part of an IT tech support professional's work.
The industry standard troubleshooting model comes from The Computing Technology Industry
Association (CompTIA).
Let's look at the process and some specifics applicable to an IT support specialist.
The CompTIA model includes the following steps:
Identify the problem.
In this step, you research the knowledge base or Internet, if applicable.
Establish a theory of probable cause.
In this step, you test the theory to determine the cause.
Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem.
If the theory is not confirmed, establish a new theory or escalate the problem.
Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects.
Implement the solution or escalate as necessary.
Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures.
And finally, document findings or lessons learned as well as actions and outcomes.
Let's look at these steps in more detail.
In the first step, you identify the problem.
Start by gathering information.
This may come from a telephone call, a ticket submitted online, or other sources.
Next, contact and question the user who submitted the issue.
Try to understand what is happening, including hardware, software, and system settings involved,
and what the user was doing when the issue occurred.
Based on the information collected, clearly try to identify the symptoms.
Let's say in this scenario, the user sees an "access denied" message when trying
to print on a network printer.
Determine if anything else has changed.
For example, are all servers up and running?
Have any servers been updated recently?
Does the user's account allow access to that printer?
If an answer is not immediately apparent, try to duplicate the problem.
If there are multiple issues it is good practice to address each problem individually.
For example, if the user also reports his monitor is also too dim, approach that separately
from the printer issue.
If the problem is not yet solved, it is time to do some research.
If your company has maintained a knowledge base, search that for similar issues that
have been resolved before.
An Internet search may also provide useful information.
Based on the information you have collected and your research, establish a theory of probable
cause.
One important starting strategy may be to question the obvious.
For example, is the printer plugged in and turned on?
Also, consider more than one approach.
For example, could this be a user machine configuration problem, or is this a network
issue?
Next, test your theory to determine the cause.
You may work with the user to verify their computer is appropriately configured, or review
network accounts and policies to see if the issue can be found there.
Did you solve the problem?
Sometimes the answer is not obvious and may require more research and testing.
If you discover the root cause of the issue is complex or systemic, establish a plan of
action.
Keep in mind that some fixes may require reboots or downtime, or require downloading software
or patches.
Perform testing in a staging environment, if available.
There may be change management processes in your IT department to perform tests.
Back up data any data that may be affected by the change, and remember,
any systems changes may require approval by other IT staff members.
The next step is to implement the solution or escalate the issue.
This may involve running scripts to correct a programmatic issue.
The solution may require updating systems or software.
The answer may also involve updating configuration files, or
a change in firewall settings may be required.
After implementing a fix, verify full system functionality and implement preventive measures
as appropriate.
Often, users are more knowledgeable about how their systems are supposed to work.
Consider asking users to test the functionality of the fix.
Also, consider if the solution may also need to be applied to other servers or devices.
An important part of the problem-resolution process is to document your findings, lessons
learned, actions taken, and outcomes of the changes.
Be sure to fully document your research, theories, changes, and updates.
If you have a knowledge base, add this information so other support professionals can reference
it in the future.
Documentation is particularly useful if the solution later causes unintended consequences.
In this video, you learned that:
The Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) has the industry standard 
troubleshooting
model.
The CompTIA model involves identifying, and researching the problem, establishing and
testing a theory, planning, implementing, and verifying a solution, and documenting
the process and results.
CompTIA troubleshooting steps are useful to tech support professionals to solve problems
for their customers.

Levels of Technical Support
Welcome to Levels of Technical Support!
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the need for tiered support
Recognize the different levels of technical support, and
Identify support procedures and skills required at each level.
What is the need for tiered or leveled support?
Having tiered support has the following advantages:
Strategically route issues to different levels of support based on the product, issue complexity,
and severity.
Having a timeline and protocol for solving issues helps the organization as it grows.
For a growing organization, tiered support helps handle a large volume of issues effectively
by using resources appropriately.
Customer satisfaction is improved by reducing their wait time.
And tiered support provides an opportunity for training tech support professionals and
gives them a chance to broaden their skill sets.
There are five levels of technical support, ranging from levels 0 to 4.
Level 0 support is the self-service level, where users can find help with FAQs or a knowledge
base.
Level 1 support is usually basic help desk service.
Level 2 support is more in-depth troubleshooting of issues.
Level 3 support includes support specialists and skilled engineers.
And level 4 is support provided by third-party businesses that might supply some parts of
the components that are not directly supported by the organization.
Let's look at the levels a little closer.
Level 0 contains self-service support,
like FAQs on a webpage or
product documentation that users can retrieve online for themselves.
It also includes chatbots for simple queries,
Discussion forums for help from other users, and
knowledge bases for support.
The next is Level 1 support, which includes Help Desk.
Common issues may involve Support helping Users navigate new applications and menus.
Using phone, email, or social media support, Level 1 generally involves basic username
and password issues, hardware and software installation, and setup issues.
If unable to address the issues, Level 1 support escalates the issue to Level 2.
Level 2 support deals with harder and more specific tasks than Level 1.
They review the steps documented by Level 1 technicians and start troubleshooting issues
escalated to them.
They have in-depth product knowledge, technical skills, and excellent communication skills
to help resolve issues and communicate the same to customers.
If an issue isn't resolved by them, customers are escalated to the Level 3 support tier.
Next is Level 3 support.
Level 3 technicians are skilled specialists and analysts with a wide range of experience
and wide access to resources needed to recreate the issue in a lab environment.
The technicians attempt to determine the root cause of the issue and this may lead to product
changes and solutions passed down to Level 1 and 2 technicians.
And the last level of support is Level 4 support, though it exists outside the organization.
It includes contracted support for products sourced from other manufacturers.
This may consist of support for printers, computers, software, machine maintenance,
and other outsourced hardware and software.
Level 3 or Level 2 support may forward some queries for review by Level 4 support.
Now, IT Support Levels usually describe the skills and access levels the IT support personnel
have.
This table shows the skills required at each support level.
At Level 0, users can browse and retrieve support information from the web or app-based
platforms, including product details, FAQs, technical information, manuals, and search functions.
Level 1 requires staff to have a basic level of technical knowledge.
They are trained to resolve known problems and fulfill service requests by following
documented standard operating procedures (SOP) or scripts.
Level 2 requires support personnel having deep knowledge and a good understanding of
the product or service.
They may or may not be the programmers or engineers who designed and created the service
or product,
but they should have adequate knowledge and experience of the specified product or service.
At level 3, Subject Matter Experts (or SMEs) and specialists typically have the highest
level of skills and are often called product specialists.
This group must have experience in solving complex problems and may include the actual
creators, engineers, programmers, or chief architects who designed and developed the
product or service.
And the final level, that is, level 4, prefers suppliers and business partners providing
support and services for products or components that are not directly supported by an organization
but are essential for customer service.
In this video, you learned that:
Tiered support is needed to route technical support issues correctly based on product,
complexity, and severity, and to improve technical support training and upskilling opportunities
for tech support professionals.
Technical support levels range from 0 to 4, of which levels 1, 2, and 3 are the main levels
of tech support.
And level 0 is a self-service tool for customers, while level 4 is usually provided from outside
the company.


Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)

Welcome to Service-level agreements (or SLAs)!
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define service-level agreements, or SLAs, in technical support,
Discuss the key differences between response and resolution SLAs, and
Identify how priority levels with SLAs are interconnected.
So what are service-level agreements, or SLAs, in technical support?
SLAs are legal agreements-or contracts-between businesses and customers.
SLAs ensure quality, timeliness, and availability of technical support.
They enable businesses to manage and meet customer expectations, and
They can be time-based, especially in technical support, when a customer might need rapid
resolution to an issue.
Imagine this scenario:
You downloaded and installed free software for an e-book reader.
You find on the FAQ page for the company some information about the help offered by their
team if you run into problems using the software.
They also detail how to contact them.
Additionally, they state how fast their support can handle your queries based on
whether you are using the free version of the software or the paid version.
When you installed and used their software, you accepted their contract and agreed to
the business's SLA.
SLA contracts will include the following:
An agreement summary with definitions, SLA measurements, and metrics used.
Goals of the business and users.
For example, what needs does the user have that the business can provide?
Consequences of violations, like financial penalties or incentives, so the business and
the customer can continue to work together, and
Points of contact so customers know who is involved, what their roles are, and the escalation
of issues.
There are 3 types of SLAs:
Customer-based SLAs, which are customized for different customers.
Service-based SLAs are for groups of customers who use a service the same.
Every customer receives the same service.
Multiple SLAs (for different types of customers, like premium or VIP) allow for variation within
the SLA to meet different needs for different parts of a business.
How are SLAs and priority levels interconnected?
SLA priority levels can be adjusted based on the impact that the issue has on the business.
The higher the impact is on the business, then the more urgent the priority is.
In the example shown here,
Level 1 has a high priority and high impact.
The issue has most likely resulted in stopping business.
Level 2 means that business has been disrupted.
Level 3 priority indicates that maybe the issue is an inconvenience for customers but
it doesn't stop the business from operating.
Level 4 is the lowest priority level in this example.
It might represent routine services like updates or changes.
SLAs will also include details about how long Support has to respond to issues and resolve
issues.
Response times are how long technical support teams have to acknowledge and start work on
an issue.
For example:
A low priority issue may have a response goal of 2 business days;
however, an urgent issue that extensively impacts business may have an immediate response
goal.
Resolution SLAs state how long the team has to resolve the issue, from start to finish.
Resolution SLAs might also have priority levels, but the time to resolve the issue may be different
from response SLAs.
Whatever your role is in technical support, you will most likely be using some form of
ticketing system to manage SLAs.
Ticketing systems will help you track, monitor, prioritize, automate, and report on SLAs for
your organization.
In this video, you learned that:
Ticketing systems help you and your organization manage SLAs.
SLAs are legal agreements between businesses and their customers that ensure quality, timeliness,
and availability of technical support.
SLAs identify priority levels depending on the urgency of issues and establish response
and resolution times.
Three types of SLAs are customer-based, service-based, and multiple SLAs, which can be a 
combination
of customer- and service-based SLAs.

What are Ticketing Systems?

e to What are ticketing systems?
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Indicate what a ticketing system is and what its used for,
Describe how ticketing systems work, and
Identify the use of ticketing systems by IT professionals.
A support ticket is an electronic document used to record the interaction between a customer
and a service representative.
It contains a record of communications and resolution efforts for a particular problem
and is useful to manage issues, questions, requests and problems your customers might
have.
A Ticket may also be referred to using terms like Issue, Case, or Incident
A support ticket is managed using a ticketing system.
These systems may also be called:
Helpdesk software,
Customer support software,
Ticketing software, or app, and
Case Management System or Customer Care Management System.
What is a ticketing system?
A ticketing system is software used to systematically
document, Track, Manage, and Resolve customer issues.
Functionally, a ticketing system facilitates the creation of tickets allowing support agents
to:
Manage,
Collaborate, and
Coordinate resolution efforts.
A ticketing system contains a central data hub designed to streamline communications
between:
Agents, Team members, and Customers.
Most ticketing systems, in addition to basic ticket management, also provide the following
capabilities.
Some automation, for example the routing of a web ticket to an appropriate resource.
Collaboration, allowing all agents and resources to freely access information to increase efficiency.
Easy integration with other or future IT management processes and applications.
Multiple channels of customer access, such as by telephone or online forms.
And reporting system performance of metrics such as:
Response time,
Volume, and
Customer satisfaction.
Here is a typical lifecycle of a ticket:
The ticket is created when a customer walks in, calls an agent, enters relevant information
in an online form, sends an email to a customer support email address, or posts on social
media.
The ticket is assigned to a customer support agent or a queue monitored by multiple agents.
This agent categorizes the ticket and assesses priority and severity.
The ticket is resolved by the resource, which may include validation, requests for further
information, or escalation.
And finally, once the issue is resolved, the ticket is closed by the agent or customer.
However, if needed, the ticket can always be reopened.
Tickets can be created from:
The customer online or using an app (as shown here).
The customer's use of a text session, such as an SMS or email to contact the support
agent.
Or, link in social media to contact the support agent.
Initially, tickets contain basic information such as:
The customer's name,
The date of the request,
The email address used to contact the customer,
The category of the problem,
And a brief description of the issue.
Also maybe some additional relevant details such as a model number.
The ticketing system may automatically assign a ticket to a specific agent based on some
business rules or logic like the time of day, who the customer is, problem category, agent
availability, etc. or may be placed in a queue from which available agents can pick a ticket
and assign it to themselves.
In some cases, a supervisor may assign the tickets in a queue to specific agents manually.
As the agent receiving the request, you open the ticket.
Note that if an online source is used, the provided information automatically appears
in the ticket.
In the case of a phone call, you would obtain and enter this information yourself.
Also note that each ticket will be assigned a ticket number.
This number will identify this ticket through its lifecycle.
The agent working on the ticket communicates with the customer to resolve the issue.
When reviewing the information provided, you in some cases may be allowed to re-assign
or forward it to a specialist or a more appropriate queue.
As part of this process, you may require additional details to troubleshoot the issue.
For example, you may get into a live chat session with the customer.
You verify the issue and instruct the customer how to resolve the problem.
Once the issue is resolved, you close the ticket and change the status in the system.
In this video, you learned that:
A ticketing system is software used to systematically manage and resolve customer issues.
The lifecycle of a ticket includes ticket creation, assigning and starting the ticket
issue, resolving the ticket issue, and closing the ticket.
And, IT support agents create tickets, start the ticket process, and resolve issues using
a variety of communication methods.

Features and Benefits of Ticketing Systems

Welcome to Features and Benefits of Ticketing Systems.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define common features of ticketing systems,
describe how tickets are tagged and routed, and
and describe how automation is critical in a ticketing system.
Comprehensive IT ticketing tools can include a number of features.
Common features of ticketing systems include:
Omnichannel support, the ability to generate tickets from different channels;
Ticket routing, the ability to assign tickets to agents or departments;
Ticket categorization and tagging, where the ticket can be classified and sorted by issue
to enable routing to a particular specialist;
Tracking and management, where the ticket contains a processing trail;
Knowledge base management, where issues solved in past tickets can be used as a resource
for addressing similar new tickets; and
Automation, the ability of the system to automatically perform tasks like route tickets, send emails,
or create alerts.
Customers can contact your help desk organization from many channels:
Email,
Social media,
Live chat, and
Phone.
Many times, the resolution of a ticket can involve more than one channel, so consolidation
of these communications in one place is important.
This preserves:
Issue specifics,
Customer conversations, and
Customer profiles in one ticket document.
Requests can come from different sources and are collected in the ticketing system.
John has a problem with a network setting.
John calls and talks with a support agent, who creates the ticket.
Sarah emails customer support with a printer issue.
A support agent receives the request and enters it into the ticketing system.
Marvin texts with a problem downloading software.
A support agent receives the message and collects specific information about the problem.
All these requests are consolidated into:
A common dashboard, where
agents can collaborate with team members,
all in one place.
A ticketing system has specific capabilities to manage the lifecycle of the ticket.
Tickets can be categorized based on:
Date,
Ticket type,
Customer, and
Issue specifics.
Tickets are then tagged with this information.
This becomes part of the ticket and may trigger automatic processes, such as routing and customer
communication.
Based on categorization, tickets are then routed to the appropriate agent.
For example, if one agent is more knowledgeable about IBM authoring, the ticket is routed
to that person.
But if the agent that first receives the ticket can resolve the issue, they work to do so.
As the ticket is worked, all customer and internal communication and other notes about
the process resolution are captured by the ticket system.
This will provide information about ticket status which can be reviewed by agents or
rolled up into a daily report.
A well-organized ticket system can help provide good customer service by resolving issues
quickly with minimum customer "back and forth."
As a ticket contains information about its management through the system, tracking the
history of the ticket is as easy as looking at the ticket itself.
A key for constant system improvement relies on analytics.
The ticketing system provides analytics for the organization to see how the tickets are
spread out, for example:
by alert level,
by ticket status, or
by the group requesting the helpdesk support.
With the ability to aggregate and report ticket information, you can also investigate what
works and areas of improvement in process improvement, performance metrics, and resource
management.
Many customers are fully capable of serving themselves and may prefer to do so if that
option is available to them.
A knowledge base system allows customers and agents to research issues.
Knowledge base systems that help customers by summarizing and storing large amounts of
information in
searchable, linked databases.
Knowledge bases can also assist agents to find resources for customers, and
knowledge bases require updates to keep content relevant.
Knowledge base access can include:
Questions to agents through messaging or chat,
searching for answers to common questions without direct agent support,
discussion groups for specific products or process types, and
product documentation and demonstrations.
Automation is a critical part of a ticketing system.
It helps tickets get to the right person at the right time.
The logistics of managing tickets can get complicated quickly.
Automation can help in:
Assigning tickets,
sending responses to customers and team members,
escalating issues based on severity,
and pulling customer data to address specific needs.
Automation reduces time spent on repetitive tasks and medial work,
making agents more engaged and productive.
In this video, you learned that:
Common features of help desk ticketing systems include omnichannel support, ticket routing,
tagging, and automation.
Ticketing systems knowledge bases contain large amounts of information and can be accessed
by customers or help desk agents during issue resolution
And automation can manage ticket flow and reduce time spent on repetitive tasks.

Lesson Summary: Troubleshooting and Ticketing 
Systems
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	The steps in the CompTIA troubleshooting model include identifying the problem, 
establishing a probable clause, testing your theory, establishing a plan of action, 
implementing the solution, or escalating the issue.
•	There are five levels of technical support. Level zero is self-service. Level one includes 
helping users navigate phone, email, social media, authentication issues, installations, and 
setups. Level two tasks are harder and more specific than level one. Level three technicians 
attempt to determine the issue's root cause, which may lead to product changes. Level four 
exists outside the organization and includes contracted support for products sourced from 
other manufacturers.
•	Resolution service level agreements (SLAs) state how long the team has to resolve an issue, 
from start to finish, whereas response SLAs give the amount of time to respond to an issue 
and are given priorities. Resolution SLAs might have priority levels, but the time to resolve 
the issue may be different from the response time.
•	Ticketing system automation can help assign tickets, send responses to customers and team 
members, escalate issues based on severity, and pull customer data to address specific needs.

What is Software Engineering?

Welcome to "What Is Software Engineering."
After watching this video, you will be able to define software engineering, list the responsibilities
of a software engineer, and compare and contrast software developers and software engineers.
Software engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of 
software.
The field uses a systematic approach to collect and analyze business requirements in order
to design, build, and test software applications to satisfy those business requirements.
When computing began in the late 1950s, software engineering was a relatively undefined 
discipline, but over time it transformed into a modernized engineering field.
The software engineering field became a discipline in the 1960s and evolved as new technologies
were developed and the approach to software development became more scientific.
Trends in software engineering transformed from ad hoc programming towards more formal
and standardized methods.
Initially, the creation of software lacked a formal development process.
As the world widely adopted computers, software became increasingly integral to more aspects
of life.
The inefficiencies in the software development process made it difficult to meet the rapidly
increasing demand for computing resources and complex software.
This led to what is known as the "Software Crisis" which began in the mid-1960s and lasted until 
the mid-1980s.
During this period, software development often ran over budget, behind schedule, and consisted
of unmanageable, buggy code.
By the time older software solutions came to fruition, newer, better, and faster technologies
had already been developed, causing software engineers to have to refactor their code, or 
completely redesign their system.
Often software development solutions that worked for small software systems did not scale to large, 
complex projects.
Some of these issues still exist today, although to a much lesser extent due to the consistent
application of engineering principles to the software development process.
Computing resources have become more widely available and standardized methodologies for
software development allow for large, complex solutions that scale.
The solution to the "Software Crisis" involved transforming unorganized coding efforts
into an established engineering discipline.
The mid 1980s also saw a rise in the growth of computer-aided software engineering or
CASE which also helped to relieve the software crisis.
CASE tools can be divided into six categories: business analysis and modelling, development
tools such as debugging environments, verification and validation tools, configuration management,
metrics and measurement, and project management.
The term "software engineer" is often used interchangeably with software developer but there are 
subtle differences.
Software engineers are also developers, but the term "software developer" is usually deemed 
narrower in scope than that of a software engineer.
A software engineer's knowledge is usually broader.
Software engineers take a systematic, big picture approach in their thinking to software 
development whereas developers may have more creative approaches.
Both software engineers and software developers have specialized knowledge, but software 
engineers
use that knowledge to build entire systems whereas software developers use their knowledge to 
write code to implement specific functionality within a system.
Software engineers are often employed on larger scale projects and they are focused on the broad 
structure rather than solving an immediate problem.
Software engineers are tasked with designing, building, and maintaining software systems.
Responsibilities include writing and testing code, and consulting with stakeholders such as clients, 
third party software vendors, security specialists, and other team members.
The adoption of a measured, scientific approach to software development has influenced the way 
software is created and designed.
Today, the development process is typically guided by the Software Development Lifecycle
or SDLC.
The SDLC identifies the steps needed to develop high-quality software.
Later in this module, we will discuss the SDLC, the traits of high-quality software, and roles 
common in the field of software engineering.
In this video you learned that:
Software engineering is the systematic approach to design and development of software.
Responsibilities of a software engineer include:
Designing, building, and maintaining software systems, writing and testing code, and consulting 
with stakeholders, third party vendors, security specialists, and other team members. And finally,
software engineers build systems while software developers implement specific functionalities.

Insiders' Viewpoint: What is software 
engineering?

Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: What is software engineering? In this video,
we will hear from experts discussing software engineering.
I think software engineering is the process of using programming languages and engineering
principles to build products. These products could look like web apps, mobile apps, dekstop
apps, operating systems, or even networking systems. It is a skill that's integral to
the success of our modern society. Because without technology, we couldn't get a lot
of things done today. Within software engineering. It's a very broad term. And so within software
engineering, you have roles such as front end, back end security, mobile test, full
stack, DevOps, cloud data, and machine learning. And these are all different types of 
engineers within software engineering.
I would define software engineering as building and improving software from anywhere from
design architecture to the user interface to fixing small bugs. So anything that falls
in that range, that's what software engineers or software engineers do
So software engineering, to me, I think really has to do with, I consider it a creative process.
And it's fundamentally is the practice of designing, envisioning implementing, and then supporting 
and maintaining software through the full lifecycle of it. So not just writing code, but, you know, 
thinking about the software you're building before you even written a line of code, the the the 
journey from idea inception to, to actual implementation and launching upset software and then 
maintaining it, improving it, supporting it, and potentially evolving into something else. So it's very 
much a sort of creative and full, full lifecycle end to end engineering process.

So I know in the United States, at least software engineering, software development programming
they all have, depending on who you ask, they mean very specific things or very hazy things or very 
contradictory things. Or it's like why do we even have three different titles for the same thing. I 
think of those titles is kind of all meaning the same thing.

RECORD NARRATION:
What s the difference between a software engineer and a 
developer?
Yeah, I think the difference for me, I consider engineering to be a little bit sort of broader software 
engineer who broader than then development, I think development to me means is sort of one part 
of the process. So I think one fundamental difference for me is I think software engineering is 
beyond just writing code, which I think a developer often is handed a task to, to write a piece of 
code, create a a module, piece of software, whatever term you want to use, I think engineering 
involves sort of starting, you know, a very long time before you even get to the development 
process and continues on beyond the time you would actually take your code, deploy it. So this kind 
of goes into the full lifecycle.
In my opinion, there isn't A difference really. So for example, I was trained as a full stack engineer 
or a full stack developer, but I was hired as a software engineer to work on the front end of the 
company's application. So I think it's a matter of semantics. And a lot of it, I think, is a lot of 
gatekeeping. To keep people who don't know anything about us about the industry out. Somebody 
who has studied CS may argue differently from IBM from ideal, but as a person with a non 
traditional path into the world of software engineering, I only see it as like title changes and title 
differences. And I think it depends on what company you work in, and what company you work for. 
Because at the end of the day, we're all using the same tools and technology to get the product 
shipped to production . I think that they are pretty similar roles. They are used interchangeably a lot, 
I think.
But I think the main difference is that software engineers are also responsible for the system design 
and architecture as well as data, how it's received, used, and how it's disseminated.
Whereas software developers, I think, focus more on the building of apps and features.

So, in Canada, being a computer programmer, or a software developer is incredibly different than 
being a computer engineer or a software engineer, where to be an engineer, it means you've taken 
specific classes in like codes of ethics. And you're held to the same ethical standards as a civil 
engineer or a mechanical engineer. And so depending on where you are, the name, the titles can 
mean very different things. And I know for purposes of immigration, the titles also can mean very 
specific things. And you have to be careful about like, what it is that you put down. But in job 
descriptions, I kind of see them all used interchangeably, and I tend to just kind of think of them all 
as the same thing.
The, you know, it's much of a more of a longer time horizon, I think, in front in terms of 
engineering versus development. I think there's a lot more considerations and hats you need to put 
on throughout the software engineering lifecycle versus the kind of more narrowly
scoped development cycle.

Introduction to the SDLC

Welcome to the introduction to the software development life cycle.
After watching this video, you will be able to describe what the software development life cycle is,
explain its history, and discuss some key advantages of using it.
The Software Development Life Cycle, known as the SDLC, is a systematic process to develop 
high-quality software in a predictable timeframe and budget.
The goal of the SDLC is to produce software that meets a client's business requirements.
The SDLC defines phases of the software development process that encompass their own process 
and deliverables.
It is a cycle of planning, design, and development that can be implemented as an iterative approach
to software development.
Adherence to the SDLC minimizes risks and costs to the development of high-quality,
deployable software.
The software development life cycle began to take shape in the mid-1960s as software development 
began to necessitate a more detailed approach because of its growing complexity.
The SDLC led to a more deliberate approach as large corporations needed to manage complex
business systems requiring heavy computational resources.
In its initial conception, it used what is called the "waterfall method" to manage projects where the 
development of software follows a linear pattern through discrete stages.
The SDLC has since been adapted, however, to more iterative methods in response to addressing
customer needs and shifting requirements.
Waterfall and other approaches to software development will be discussed in another lesson.
There are some key advantages for businesses in following the SDLC.
The first advantage is that it gives development teams a process to follow rather than using an ad 
hoc approach to improve efficiency and reduce risks.
Secondly, there are discrete phases to the SDLC.
Each phase is well defined so that team members know what they should be working on and when.
The phases of the SDLC will be discussed in another video.
Because of the well-defined phases, it facilitates communication between the customer, other
stakeholders, and the development team.
The SDLC offers an overview of the process, so stakeholders know where they fit in to that process.
Also, since each phase is discrete, cross-domain teams know when they have completed their tasks 
and when development can move to the next phase.
The SDLC provides room for iteration where, at the end of a cycle, the process can circle back to 
incorporate additional requirements as needed.
Problem solving is incorporated early in the cycle so problems are addressed in a timely fashion and 
can be addressed in the design phase rather than during coding.
Finally, each team member has a well-defined role which reduces conflict and overlapping 
responsibilities.
In this video you learned that the SDLC provides a systematic process for software development.
Its initial development in the 60s and 70s was driven by the need for a systematic approach because 
of the growing complexity of software.
Key advantages of the SDLC include:
A roadmap to the software development process, helping to reduce risk and improve efficiency,
Increased communication between the team and stakeholders, Clearly defined and understood 
responsibilities for each team member, and The ability to be used iteratively, allowing for changing 
requirements.

Phases of the SDLC

Welcome to the Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
After watching this video, you will be able to
name the phases involved in the SDLC,
describe each phase, and
identify several tasks associated with each phase.
There are generally six phases in the SDLC process, planning, design, development, testing, 
deployment, and maintenance.
Each phase is discrete meaning that tasks from a previous phase do not overlap with
tasks in the next phase.
The original SDLC was conceived as a traditional waterfall method where the phases were linear,
but have since been adapted to introduce iteration so that shifting requirements can be 
accommodated.
Waterfall and other approaches to software development will be discussed in another video.
Note that some organizations may have different names for each stage.
For example, "planning" may be called "requirements" or "strategy" or "analysis".
Also, some organizations may have additional or fewer stages.
In the first stage of the SDLC, the planning phase, requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented 
and prioritized.
When planning a software solution, the following factors must be considered:
users of the solution
the overall purpose of the solution,
data inputs and outputs,
legal and regulatory compliance,
risk identification,
quality assurance requirements,
allocation of human and financial resources, and project scheduling.
As part of the planning process, labour and material costs are estimated and weighed against time 
constraints.
Also, project teams are identified, and roles of each team member are proposed.
If stakeholders are struggling to define requirements, often the development team may produce 
prototypes during the planning stage to tease out those requirements.
A prototype is a small-scale replica of the end product used to get stakeholder feedback and 
establish requirements.
A prototype is used to test basic design ideas.
Though prototyping usually occurs during the planning stage, prototyping can occur at various
phases of the SDLC whenever requirements need to be reconsidered or clarified as the project
develops.
After requirements have been gathered, they are combined into a document called a software 
requirements specification, or SRS, document.
The SRS needs to be clearly understood and approved by all stakeholders.
The developers are also involved at this stage so they can gain a clear understanding of
these requirements.
Requirements and the SRS will be discussed in more detail in a later video.
In the design phase, the requirements
gathered from the SRS are used to develop the software architecture.
Several team members work together at this stage to design the architecture.
The architecture is reviewed by the stakeholders and team.
During this phase, prototypes can be designed.
A prototype is a preliminary mock-up of the system, or parts of the system, used for demonstration
purposes.
The document created in this phase is called a design document, and is used by developers
during the next phase, which is the development phase.
The development phase, sometimes called the "building" phase or the "implementation"
phase, is when the developers start the coding process once the design document is completed.
The project planners use the design document to determine and assign coding tasks.
This phase often requires the use of programming tools, different programming languages, and
software stacks.
Organizations may also have standards or guidelines that need to be followed.
The testing phase is next in the process once the coding is complete.
Some large projects have dedicated testing teams.
Code needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure it is stable, secure, and meets the requirements
outlined in the SRS.
Testing can be manual, automated, or a hybrid of both.
Product bugs are reported, tracked, and fixed, and code is retested until the software is
stable.
Some common levels of testing include
unit testing,
integration testing,
system testing, and
acceptance testing.
Each of these testing levels will be described in further detail in another video.
The deployment phase is where the application is released into the production environment
and made available to users.
This can also happen in stages-
first, it is released onto a user acceptance testing, also called UAT, platform and once
the customer signs off on the functionality,
it is released to production.
This approach can be used for making software available on a website, mobile device app
store, or a software distribution server on a corporate network.
The maintenance phase happens once the code has been deployed into a production environment.
This phase helps to
find any other bugs,
identify user interface issues, or UI for short, and
identify other requirements that may not have been listed in the SRS.
Code enhancements can also be identified at this stage.
If bugs are discovered in this phase that were missed during testing, these errors may
need to be fixed for high-priority issues or incorporated into the requirements as part
of a future software release and the process can start over again.
In this video, you learned that
The SDLC can be divided into six phases,.Planning involves requirement gathering and 
development
of the SRS.
The architecture is developed during the design phase and the design document is created.
The Development phase is when coding takes place, and then
during the testing phase issues with the code are found and fixed if possible.
Deployment is when the code is released to the production environment.
Finally, in the maintenance stage feedback is collected from stakeholders, other UI issues
may be identified, and code enhancements suggested.
This information then can be fed into another software development cycle if necessary.

Requirements

Welcome to Requirements.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the steps of the requirement gathering process.
Explain the purpose of a User Requirement Specification, or URS, document.
Explain the purpose of a Software Requirement Specification, or SRS, document, and
Explain the purpose of a System Requirement Specification, or SysRS, document
Requirement gathering is a six-step process of defining a problem to
be solved and documenting how to go about solving that problem. These steps include:
identifying stakeholders,
establishing goals and objectives,
eliciting requirements from the stakeholders,
documenting the requirements,
analyzing and confirming the requirements, and
prioritizing.
Generally, the stakeholders work for the organization that
requests the development of the software product.
Key personnel from the organization may include
decision-makers,
end-users,
system administrators,
engineering,
marketing,
sales,
and customer support personnel.
It is good to have a representative from every group that the product affects.
The goals of the product should be clearly defined.
Goals are broad, long-term achievable outcomes.
Goals can include customer outcomes and business goals.
Next, objectives should be identified. Objectives are more specific than goals
and they are actionable and measurable actions that achieve the stated goals.
The next three steps, eliciting, documenting,
and requirement confirmation are usually completed iteratively.
Elicitation can be accomplished through surveys, questionnaires, and interviews.
As the requirements emerge, they should be documented and checked to ensure they align with the 
goals and objectives.
Documented requirements should be easily understood by stakeholders and the project team.
In order to confirm the requirements, they should be analysed to ensure consistency, clarity,
and completeness. After analysis, the requirements should be shared with and approved by the 
stakeholders.
After confirmation, requirements should be prioritized. Labels such as "must-have," "highly 
desired," and "nice to have" are helpful. If possible, order the requirements within those categories.
Typically, there may be three documents that result from the requirements gathering process:
software requirements specification, or SRS,
user requirements specification, or URS,
and system requirements specification, or SysRS. 
The most common of these is the software requirements specification.
The software requirements specification, or SRS, is a document that captures the functionalities that 
the software should perform and also establishes benchmarks or service levels for its performance.
Parts of an SRS include:
A purpose statement that contains the intended use of the SRS, its audience and scope, constraints, 
assumptions and dependencies, and requirements, which can be sorted into four categories:
Functional requirements
External Interface requirements
System Features
Non-functional requirements
The product's purpose describes who will have access to the SRS and how they should use it.
The scope describes the benefits of the software, its goals, and objectives.
The second part of the SRS should detail constraints, assumptions, and dependencies.
Constraints describe how the product must operate under given conditions that may limit options in 
the design phase such as conformation to standards or hardware limitations.
Assumptions may include things like a required operating system or hardware that is needed by the 
software to function.
Dependencies on other software products should also be noted.
Requirements can be classified into four categories.
Functional requirements are those that cover the functionalities of the software.
External requirements are the requirements that address the behaviour of the software in relation to 
external entities such as users and interactions with other hardware or software.
System features are a subset of functional requirements.
These are required features for the system to function.
There are also non-functional requirements such as specifying performance, safety, security, and 
quality standards.
User requirements describe the business need and expectations
of the end-users from the software system.
The user requirements are written as "user stories" or
"use cases" that answer three questions:
Who is the user?
What is the function that needs to be performed?
Why does the user want this functionality?
User acceptance testing determines if these requirements have been met.
Often though, the user requirements and software requirements are combined
into a single SRS document. The SRS details the expectations of the software system.
The System Requirement Specification document, or SysRS, to differentiate it from
the SRS, clearly outlines the requirements of an entire system. The system requirement
specification is often used interchangeably with software requirement specification,
but the SysRS is actually broader in scope than the SRS.
Many software projects develop an SRS rather than a SysRS.
The SysRS contains system capabilities, interfaces, and user characteristics. It also may 
include policy requirements, regulation requirements, personnel requirements, performance 
requirements, security requirements, and system acceptance criteria.
It also outlines expectations of the hardware needed for the system in addition to software 
requirements.

In this video you learned that:
The requirement gathering process entails identifying stakeholders, establishing
goals and objectives, and eliciting, documenting, confirming, and then prioritizing requirements.
The SRS documents functional, external, system, and non-functional requirements.
The URS documents user stories.
And finally, the SysRS documents system capabilities and acceptance criteria,
and policy, regulation, personnel, performance, security, and hardware requirements.

Software Development Methodologies

Welcome Software Development Methodologies.
After watching this video, you will be able to list several commonly used approaches to the 
software development life cycle, explain waterfall, V-shape model, and Agile methods, and
compare the pros and cons of each of these three methods.
There are many ways to approach software development.
A specific methodology for developing software is commonly used in order to assist the 
development
team to clarify communication among team members and determine how and when information is
shared.
In this video, we will discuss three of these approaches:
Waterfall,
V-shape model,
and Agile.
In the beginning, when the SDLC was conceived, it implemented what is known as the
waterfall method.
Waterfall is a sequential method of software development where the output of one phase
is the input for the next phase of the cycle.
Development and work on the next phase start only after the completion of the previous
phase.
All planning, such as defining requirements and architectural design, is done up front.
The customer usually does not see the product until it is in the testing phase.
For a major version release of the product, the same process is repeated resulting in
long intervals, such as years, between releases.
The V-shape model is named as such because the phases form the shape of a V.
The phases going down the left side of the V are called "verification".
Then, going up the right side of the V, those phases are called, "validation."
The V-shape model is like waterfall in that it is also sequential.
Each phase in verification corresponds with a validation phase.
There are four stages that occur on each side of the V. Going down the V are planning, system
design, architecture design, and then module design.
The bottom of the V is the coding phase.
And going back up the V are four phases that correspond to the phases going down the V:
unit testing,
integration testing,
system testing, and
acceptance testing.
The tests are written during the verification phases on the left and executed during the
validation stages on the right.
Now, the Agile model is different.
It focuses on a collaborative software development process over multiple short cycles rather
than a strictly top-down linear process.
Agile is what is called an iterative approach to development.
It still aligns with the SDLC, but each phase is short.
Teams work in cycles, or sprints, which are usually one to four weeks long.
Unit testing happens in each sprint to minimize the risk of failure.
Rather than the "maintenance" stage of the SDLC, the final stage of the sprint is a feedback stage.
At the end of each sprint, a chunk of working code is released at a meeting called the "sprint
demo" where stakeholders can see the new functionality and provide feedback.
After the sprint demo, the entire process is repeated for every sprint cycle.
After several sprint cycles, a minimum viable product, or MVP, is developed so stakeholders
can provide feedback on the basic feature set.
The MVP contains a feature set to validate assumptions about the software.
The four core values of Agile development outlined in what is known as the "Agile manifesto"
are:
individuals and interactions over processes and tools
working software over comprehensive documentation
customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and
responding to change over following a plan.
The main difference between traditional SDLC methods such as
waterfall and the v-shape model compared to the
Agile method of software development is the former are sequential whereas
Agile is cyclical.
Traditional SDLC methods, such as waterfall and V-shape, center around the whole product
being developed before soliciting customer feedback, whereas
Agile focuses on quick, short bursts of development.
There are pros and
cons to each method, though Agile is probably the most popular method used in modern software
development.
Regarding the pros of the waterfall method, it is easy to understand and follow.
Each stage is discrete and well-defined, making it easy for all team members to understand
their roles.
Also, since planning is done upfront, it is easier than iterative methods to estimate
a budget and allocate resources.
That said, waterfall lacks flexibility.
Since all planning is done upfront if a requirement is changed or overlooked that change can be
hard to incorporate at a later date.
Inevitably, unforeseen complications happen, or agreed upon functionality shifts from what
was initially envisioned.
Like waterfall, the V-shape model is simple and easy to use.
It is even more rigid than waterfall but
designing test plans during the verification phase saves considerable time during coding
and validation phases.
Drawbacks are also similar to waterfall because it
does not readily accommodate changing requirements.
Once an application is in the testing phase it is extremely difficult to go back and change
functionality.
Agile development is different, relying on ongoing research, planning, and testing during
product development.
When adding new features to a project, development still goes through the same phases as in 
traditional SDLC, but with Agile, new, and changing requirements are handled quickly and easily 
because planning is initiated at the beginning of each sprint cycle.
Most resources are spent on the building phase.
At the end of each cycle, the QA team, stakeholders, and the customer have some piece of working
code to test against requirements and are encouraged to provide feedback.
As coding languages and technologies have developed in recent years, they now allow
for modular design, where developers can focus on smaller chunks of code that are readily
integrated into the larger product.
These small chunks can be released to provide the MVP.
Cons of Agile are that upfront planning such as budgeting and scheduling can be challenging
because the
overall scope of the product is not clearly defined.
In this video, you learned that:
Three of the common approaches to software development include waterfall, V-shape model,
and Agile
waterfall and V-shape are sequential whereas Agile is iterative
both waterfall and V-shape models are easy to implement but neither accommodates changing
requirements well and
Agile allows for changing requirements but resource allocation can be challenging.

Software Versions

Welcome to Software Versions.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Discuss software versions on computing platforms
and identify software versions and numbering.
Software versions tell us a lot about programs and applications.
Users can determine what software version they are using, and developers can provide
useful information with version numbers.
Software version numbers vary in length and meaning; however, most version numbers follow
a similar format and represent similar information.
Version numbers indicate when the software was released, when it was updated, and if
any minor changes or patches were made to the software.
Software versioning is how software developers keep track of new software, updates, and patches
for programs and applications.
Version numbers can be displayed in several ways.
Version numbers can be short or long, depending on the software and the preference of the
developer, with 2, 3, or 4 number sets.
Each number set is divided by a period.
The first release of an application or program might have a 1.0 as the version number to
indicate no updates, patches, or fixes to the software.
Note: A version still in beta or testing could have a version number lower than 1, such as
0.9.
A program or application with many releases and updates will have a longer number, sometimes
4 different number sets within the version number
Some software developers may use dates for their versioning.
For example: Ubuntu Linux version 18.04.2 was released in 2018 April.
The third number set, point-2, designates an additional change or update.
What do these numbers mean?
Some version numbers follow the semantic numbering system and have 4 parts separated by a 
period,
but not all numbering systems follow this 4-part example.
In semantic numbering , the first number indicates major changes to the software, such as a new
release.
The second number indicates that minor changes were made to the software.
The third number in the version number indicates patches or minor bug fixes.
Finally, the fourth number indicates a build number or a build date, and it can indicate
less significant changes made.
Software version numbers are identified in the About or Help section of software.
You can practice identifying your version number in a web browser.
This example illustrates how to view the version number in the Google Chrome desktop web 
browser;
however, if you are using a different web browser, you should be able to follow the
same or similar steps.
To view the browser version:
First, select the three dots or three lines in the top-right corner of your browser.
Next, select the menu item "Help."
Then, select "About" to view the version information.
The version of your web browser will display.
Are newer versions of software compatible with older versions?
Lack of compatibility between old and new versions of software is a common problem.
You can troubleshoot compatibility issues by viewing the software version to determine
if you are using an outdated version of the software.
Sometimes updating software to a newer version will resolve compatibility issues.
Some software is backwards compatible.
If a program or application is backwards compatible, then the older versions of files, programs,
and systems will work properly with newer versions.
In this video, you learned that:
Version numbers indicate the history of changes, updates, and patches to software,
Some version numbers follow the semantic numbering system and have 4 parts separated by a 
period,
Compatibility with old and new versions of software is a common problem,
and you should view the version of the software you are using to determine software compatibility.

Software Testing

Welcome to Software Testing.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Define the terms functional testing, non-functional testing, regression testing  and
Compare and contrast typical testing levels .
Software Testing is the practice of integrating quality checks throughout the software development
cycle.
The purpose of testing is to check whether the software matches expected requirements and
ensure error-free software.
In order to test software, the team writes "test cases."
These test cases are written to verify the functionality of a software application and ensure 
requirements have been satisfied.
Test cases can be written in different stages of the SDLC and may vary depending on the type of 
test or the method used to develop the software, such as Agile or waterfall.
A test case contains:
steps, inputs, data, and the expected corresponding outputs. Regardless of the test type or 
development method, test cases should always be written after requirements are finalized.
Software testing helps evaluate the software to identify whether or not the software product
meets requirements and is error-free.
Types of testing can be broadly classified into three categories:
Functional testing
Non-Functional testing
Regression testing
Functional testing usually involves black box testing which is a method of testing without 
looking at source code or internal structure.
Functional testing is only concerned with inputs and corresponding outputs of the system under test, 
also called the SUT. It is entirely based on testing functional requirements.
Functional testing can be carried out manually or using automated tools.
The goal is to test the functionality of the application making sure the application is usable and
accessible. Functional testing tests the SUT, to make sure it meets functional requirements.
Functional testing makes certain that when user errors or input edge cases do occur, the software 
handles those exceptions seamlessly by displaying appropriate error messages.
Non-functional testing includes testing the application for attributes like performance,
security, scalability, and availability. Non-functional testing checks to see if the SUTs non-
functional behaviour is performing properly.
Non-functional testing should answer questions like the following:
How does the application behave under stress?
What happens when many users log in at the same time?
Are the instructions in documents and user manuals consistent with the application's
behavior?
Does the application behave similarly under different operating systems?
How does the application handle disaster recovery?
How secure is the application?
Regression testing, also called maintenance testing, confirms that a recent change to
the application, such as a bug fix, does not adversely affect already existing functionality.
Regression testing should occur when there has been a change in requirements or when
defects have been fixed.
In order to conduct regression testing, all or some of the test cases should be selected
to test against the application. Regression test case selection and prioritization can
be challenging and can depend on several factors.
Common reasons for regression test case selection include cases that:
have frequent defects , contain frequently used functionality, contain features with recent changes,
or are complex test cases, edge cases, and randomly successful or failed test cases.
Now that we have discussed different types of testing, let's discuss testing levels.
There are four testing levels:
unit, integration, system, and acceptance.
Each level occurs at a different time in the SDLC. There are 4 different levels in order
to reduce the amount of time spent on testing by preventing overlap. We will discuss each
of these testing levels next.
Unit testing refers to tests that verify the functionality of a specific section of code,
usually at the function level.
It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the development phase of
the software development life cycle.
Unit testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is integrated with other
modules. Unit testing is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well
as the efficiency of the overall development process.
Integration testing
seeks to identify errors when two or more smaller, independent code modules are combined.
Integration testing is another type of black-box testing.
Prior to integration testing, smaller, independent code modules that passed unit
testing are incorporated into the larger software application.
After modules are integrated together, then integration testing can occur.
Integration testing exposes bugs that occur when those smaller units of code interact
with each other.
Integration testing uncovers deficiencies in communication with a new module in conjunction with
other existing modules, databases, or external hardware. Integration testing uncovers situations 
where bugs develop due to differing programming logic between modules, for instance. Also, 
sometimes during module development, requirements change, and the module isn't fully unit tested. 
Poor exception handling can cause problems when modules are integrated together.
System testing occurs after integration testing and is conducted on a complete, integrated
system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.
It validates the system as a fully completed software product.
System testing is both functional and non-functional.
System testing is done in a staging environment, which should be similar to the production
environment. And finally, acceptance testing is formal testing with respect to user needs, 
requirements, and business
processes. It determines whether a system satisfies the needs of the users, customers, and other 
stakeholders. Acceptance testing is usually done by the customer or the stakeholders during the 
maintenance stage of the SDLC.

In this video you learned that:
There are three categories of testing: functional, non-functional, and regression .
Unit testing verifies small, independent chunks of code.
Integration testing looks for errors when two or more small chunks of code are combined.
System testing validates the system as a fully completed software product and
acceptance testing verifies correct implementation of user requirements and business processes.

Software Documentation

Hello and welcome to Software Documentation.
After watching this video,you will be able to:
List documentation formats.
Compare and contrast product documentation to process documentation.
Describe the categories and types of documentation.
And explain the purpose of standard operating procedures.
Software documentation is information about the software that describes what the product
is and how to use it. These can be written, video, or graphical assets associated with a software 
product's development and use.
Documentation can be in any of these three formats.
Documentation is an essential aspect of software engineering applicable across all the phases
of SDLC.
Software Documentation can be written for different types of audiences - such as end
users, software developers, QA engineers, system administrators and other stakeholders.
Documentation can be divided into two categories, product and process.
Product documentation relates to the product's functionality, whereas process documentation
describes how to complete a task.
Process documentation should provide the requirements for the quality implementation of a 
business
process.
Now, let's discuss some specific types of product documentation.
There are many types of documentation. We will discuss five categories including
requirements,
design,
technical,
quality assurance,
and user documentation.
Requirements documentation is written during the planning phase of the SDLC and is intended
for the development team including the developers, architects, and QA personnel.
Requirements documentation describes the expected features and functionality of the software
system.
It includes the software requirements specifications, system requirement specifications, and user
acceptance specifications.
Design documentation is written by the software architects and the development team to explain
how the software will be built to meet the requirements.
It consists of both conceptual and technical design documents.
Technical documentation includes comments written in the code to help other developers
read the code to understand its behavior. It also may include working papers that explain
how the code works and documents that record engineers' ideas and thoughts during project
implementation.
Quality assurance documentation includes all documents that pertain to a testing team's
strategy, progress, and metrics.
Types of test documentation include test plans, test data, test scenarios, test cases, test
strategies, and traceability matrices. Traceability matrices map test cases to their requirements.
User documentation is intended for end-users and explains how to operate the software or
help them to install or troubleshoot the system.
End-user documentation includes frequently asked questions, installation and help guides,
tutorials, and user manuals.
Standard operating procedures, called SOPs, often accompany process documentation.
Process documentation provides an overview of a process, but SOPs go through much greater
detail. The SOP is written documentation that explains step-by-step how to accomplish a
common, yet complex task that is organization specific. For example, checking in code using
a code repository is common knowledge for a software engineer.
However, an organization might have specific steps to follow for that organization in order
to get code merged into the main branch.
The SOP documentation explains those steps in detail. SOPs can be in the form of a
flowchart,
a hierarchical outline,
or step-by-step instructions.
Documentation, in any form, must be kept up to date. Take for instance online user manuals.
If a cloud-based application user interface changes, then the accompanying online documentation
must be updated accordingly. Businesses need to ensure they allot resources for this step.
With regards to the software development and the SDLC, updating documentation happens during
the maintenance phase.
Ideally, documentation should also be reviewed periodically to ensure its accuracy.
In this video you learned that:
Documentation comes in three formats: written, video, or graphical.
Process documentation describes how to complete a task.
Product documentation relates to how a product functions.
The types of product documentation include requirements, design, technical, QA, and user.
And SOPs are written instructions detailing an organisation procedure.

Roles in Software Engineering Projects
Welcome to Roles in Software Engineering Projects.
After watching this video, you will be able to
list the common roles on a software engineering project,
describe each role, and explain the responsibilities of each role.
There are several common roles on a software development project. And these roles can have
different names depending on the approach being used, such as Agile or waterfall. Sometimes
different companies have different names for similar jobs. But, not all projects will have
all these roles. The roles we will discuss in this video are
project manager or scrum master, stakeholder,
system or software architect, UX designer,
software developer, tester or QA engineer,
site reliability or Ops engineer, product manager or owner, and
technical writer or information developer. Now let's describe each role and some of
the responsibilities for each job.
Traditional SDLC methods have project managers but in Agile the equivalent
role is called a Scrum master. A project manager makes sure
the project runs smoothly and facilitates communication about the project. The project
manager often deals with bigger picture issues such as:
Planning, scheduling, and budgeting; Allocating personnel and resources;
Executing the software plan; and Team communication.
In Agile, there is a Scrum master. Rather than focusing on planning, the Scrum master
is focused on ensuring team and individual success. Remember that the four
core Agile values prioritize people and communication over
process, and the Scrum master is responsible for facilitating that communication.
The stakeholders are the people for whom the product is being designed.
They include individuals such as the customer, end-users, decision-makers, system administrators,
and other key personnel. The stakeholder is mainly responsible for defining project requirements 
and providing feedback if the team members need clarification on requirements or if a proposed 
solution cannot be solved as planned.
The stakeholders may also sometimes participate in beta testing and acceptance testing before
the software is released.
The system architect, designs and describes the architecture of a project as well as communicates 
that architecture to team members.
They are sometimes also called a software architect or a solution architect.
They are responsible for designing the essential characteristics of the inner structure and technical 
aspects of the software. The architect provides technical support across the different stages of the 
SDLC.
Note: software architecture will be discussed in further detail in another module.
UX means user experience. The goal of a UX designer is to balance making the software intuitive 
but also as robust as it needs to be to address requirements.
They define how the software behaves from the user's perspective.
The UX designer determines how the software communicates its functionality to the end-user and 
how the end-user interacts with it.
Next, the developers write the code that powers the software.
Responsibilities include implementing the architecture laid out in the design document, 
incorporating the requirements laid out in the software requirements specification, and employing 
the UX requirements determined by the UX designers.
Testers or QA engineers are in-charge of ensuring the quality of the product
and that the software solution meets customer requirements.
They are responsible for writing and executing test cases to identify bugs or deficiencies and 
provide this feedback to the development teams.
A site reliability engineer, sometimes called an SRE or ops engineer, bridges development and 
operation by combining software engineering expertise with IT systems management. They track 
incidents and facilitate meetings to discuss them. They also automate systems, procedures, and
processes; assist with trouble shooting; and ensure reliability for the customer.
The product manager or product owner has the vision of what the product should look like.
They have an intimate understanding of the client's requirements,
and the end-user's needs. They are responsible for
leading development efforts to create the software and
for ensuring the product provides the value stakeholders are looking for.
Finally, the technical writer or information developer
writes documentation for the end-user. They write documentation on
technical material geared towards a non-technical audience. Not only does this documentation
help the end-user to use the software, but it also helps the customer so they can provide
timely feedback to the development teams. Technical writers may be asked to write
user manuals, reports,
white papers, and press releases.
In this video you learned that: There are a variety of job roles on a software
development project and each occupation has responsibilities unique to each role.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Job Roles in Software 
Engineering Teams

Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Job Roles in Software Engineering Teams.
In this video we will hear from experts discussing the various job roles you can expect to work
with on your Software Engineering team.
On the engineering team I worked with, we had a product manager, we had a tech lead,
we had a QA, we had a few QA analysts or test engineers.
And we also had access to UX designers.
And so the product manager ensured that we were on task and on track to deliver the features
that we said we were going to build according to the business needs, that way we're not
left behind.

Yeah, I think, in my experience, the roles that the software engineers would interact
with the most, I think would, you know, in no particular order product managers, so the
folks who are actually sort of working with the sales teams, the marketing teams, figuring
out what actually needs to be built, what our customer needs, what are innovations and ideas that, 
you know, looking forward, that we might, you might want to invest in and build out.
We asked our experts to describe these job roles in software engineering teams in further detail

I think software engineering these days, as it becomes more and more, more more and more
large scale, more complex more systems at play.
More considerations, there's just a lot of things to consider in today's in today's world as a software 
engineer, so you often work with a project or program manager who helps you set up your your 
your timelines, helps you ensure you're meeting your goals, helps you unblock yourself helps you 
keep your stakeholders community up to date with what is what is happening with your project.
So there's just a lot of pieces involved.
And I think project and program managers really are there to help tie it all together.

So the product manager would always act someone like a scrum master.
So like, we would have stand ups.
And we would talk about the tickets that we had in JIRA.
And it was it was like, okay, so what are you working on?
What do you need help with?
And are there any issues.
And during that process, the product manager does ensure that we were on task and on track,
and if we had any issues, he would help us to resolve it with the QA engineers or the
testers.
You'll have a software engineer who's more focused on the architecture and they can keep
the the big picture in their brain more easily.
And then some software engineers who are more than nitty gritty, I'm sitting down and I am writing 
code and my my job is to like, turn business logic into computer logic.
And some companies have those all split out as different roles.

I think software engineers, and then these roles that the more they're embedded and work closely 
together and actually collaborate as part of a single team.
versus handing off things in a more waterfall approach.
I think that that's generally the the best way, or was one of the most effective ways
is to actually work together as much as possible regular check ins, actually having, you know,
brainstorming sessions, group chats that involve all the various folks, all the roles, I think,
close collaboration, there is super key
And at some companies, all the different hats have their own titles.
So you might be talking to a software engineer who's actually doing more kind of DevOps 
infrastructure
building, monitoring and alerting kinds of work.
And then there's a software engineer who's also doing QA work.
And they're the ones who are focusing on pipelines and continuous continuous development, 
continuous
integration type projects, working on getting test suites and automation all set up.
In terms of working with the UX designer or the UX engineer, they would give me like specific
specs from figma.
In order to meet the certain specifications of the business, it's let's say, we're building
a checkout page.
So the UX UX designer would design the spec page and figma and then deliver that spec
to me, and then I would code it according to the design.
UX designers who actually come up with it, if you work, if you're working on an engineering
or user interface, you work with UX designers to, to essentially from the moment of sketching
out sort of a, you know, a draft on paper or whiteboard of an idea all the way down
to working with them on mocks and implementing the mocks iterating.
On those UX researchers often are worked with when you actually need to go out and do research
and market and interview your partners or customers to get sort of as real time as possible.
And just, you know, real feedback from real users of your, of your software.
So once I code something, I get it reviewed by my tech lead or my senior engineer, it
would go to QA for them to test the application to ensure that whatever I did or implemented,
didn't break anything.
If something is broken, that I didn't catch, the QA tester would write up like a test plan
or would do like a detailed testing document.
That way I understood exactly what needed to be resolved.
And I would resolve it, and then go back to the QA person and say, Hey, this is fixed,
can you take a look at it again, and they would tell me whether or not it's fixed and
whether or not something else was broken, which often happens with code.

So you know, you generally work a lot with product managers, because you need to know
what to build.
And they generally give you a lot of guidance on, on what they want to build, and you collaborate
with them in terms of how to build it and discuss trade offs and timelines, and expectations.
So it's a very much a collaborative process.
Typically, I have found that I interact most with product owners.
So either at some places, it's been a customer who works inside the company.
And so I go to them quite frequently for questions on clarifying refinements for getting test
schedules up and running for figuring out pain points and trying to optimize their workflow
workflows using technology to support them.
Software engineers work often with site reliability engineers, or sis admins is maybe there, the
role could be called to actually maintain and help run the software and deploy it and
actually get it running somewhere that's not on your desktop, you often work with more
dedicated test engineers who are responsible for end to end testing, automated testing,
integration testing, at all, at all points of the lifecycle.
So as an engineer, you're never alone.
You're never working alone.
It's just a matter of like knowing how to communicate directly with the people on your
team.

Summary & Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know: 
•	Software engineering is the application of scientific principles to the design and creation of 
software. 
•	Responsibilities of a software engineer include designing, building, and maintaining 
software systems.  
•	Using the SDLC can improve efficiency and reduce risks by:  
•	letting team members know what they should be working on and when  
•	facilitating communication between the customer, other stakeholders, and the development 
team 
•	letting stakeholders know where they fit into that process and  
•	letting cross-domain teams know when they have completed their tasks so development can 
move to the next phase.   
•	Common software engineering processes are requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, 
releasing, and documenting. 
•	The requirement gathering process entails identifying stakeholders, establishing goals and 
objectives, eliciting requirements from the stakeholders, documenting the requirements, 
analyzing, prioritizing, and confirming the requirements. 
•	An SRS is a document that captures the functionalities that the software should perform and 
also establishes benchmarks or service levels for its performance. 
•	A URS is a subset of the SRS that details user specification requirements. 
•	The SysRS contains the same information as an SRS, but can also additionally include 
system capabilities, interfaces, and user characteristics, policy requirements, regulation 
requirements, personnel requirements, performance requirements, security requirements, and 
system acceptance criteria. 
•	Waterfall, V-shape model, and agile are all different methodologies for implementing the 
software development life cycle. 
•	Functional testing is concerned with inputs and corresponding outputs of the system under 
test, non-functional testing tests for attributes such as performance, security, scalability, and 
availability. Whereas regression testing confirms that a recent change to the application, 
such as a bug fix, does not adversely affect already existing functionality. 
•	Types of documentation include requirements, design, technical, quality assurance, and 
user. 
•	There are many different roles involved in a software engineering project. Some of them 
include project manager or scrum master, stakeholder, system or software architect, UX 
designer, software developer, tester or QA engineer, site reliability or Ops engineer, product 
manager or owner, and technical writer or information developer. 

Introduction to Software 
Development
Overview of Web and Cloud Development

Hello, welcome to Overview of Web and Cloud Development. When you're starting out as a Web 
Developer, it can be difficult to determine what you need to learn and what order you should learn
it in. Understanding how familiar websites are constructed and delivered to you is a good starting 
point. Let's review the basics of how you interact with a website. You launch an internet browser - 
there are lots available: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari are 
some of the most popular. The browser has an address bar, into which you enter a URL, like 
www.IBM.com. The browser then contacts the server with the name and requests the information 
that makes up the website. The server then sends a response, which contains the data that the client 
requires to display the website. For most websites, the server will return: HTML, which defines the 
structure of the page, but doesn't look very attractive CSS, which adds style and flair to the page 
and JavaScript, which adds interactivity and dynamic content. Content displayed by websites can 
contain elements that are either previously stored on the server (called "static") or generated each 
time they are requested by the client (called "dynamic"). Dynamic elements can involve 
information coming from other systems and applications, such as databases. Most websites contain 
static and dynamic elements to provide the best user experience. Cloud Applications are similar to 
Websites in that they request content that a server returns. Cloud Apps are built to work seamlessly 
with a Cloud-based back-end infrastructure, Cloud-based data storage and data processing, and 
other Cloud services, making them very scalable and very resilient. The environment for building 
websites and Cloud Applications is divided into two primary areas: front-end and back-end.
The front-end deals with everything that happens at the client-side - everything the user can 
see and interact with. You can choose to specialize in front-end coding, using HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript and related frameworks, libraries, and tools. The back-end deals with everything 
that happens on the server before the code and data are sent to the client. The back-end 
coding usually handles the logic and functionality that make the website or app work, and the 
authentication processes that keep data secure. Back-end developers may also work with 
relational or noSQL databases, even collaborating with database administrators in bigger 
projects. Full-stack developers have skills, knowledge, and experience in both front-end and 
back-end environments. Whichever way you choose to specialize, you will need the appropriate 
tools to help you work. The first tool most developers add to their resources is a code editor. 
Developers also need tools to integrate, build, compile, and debug code. Integrated Development 
Environments or IDEs incorporate some of these additional capabilities beyond just code 
editing and make it easier to build and manage your code. Good IDEs support multiple 
languages and integrate with management and storage tools like Git and GitHub. Other 
useful features are custom extensions and themes for supporting your working style and 
environment. Examples for code editors and IDEs include Sublime Text, Atom, Vim, VS Code, 
Visual Studio, Eclipse and NetBeans. In this brief overview, you learned about: The basic 
communication between client and servers. How websites are built and displayed. Front-end 
development is about what happens on the client side. Back-end development is about what 
happens on the server. Full-stack development incudes both front-end and back-end development. 
IDEs will help you create and manage your code.

Learning Front-End Development
Internet websites offer lots of different services, one of the most popular being online
shopping.
When you explore an online shopping website, navigating through pages, choosing different
product categories, or comparing products, you are interacting with the front-end of
a website.
Let us see how the front-end of a website is developed by front-end developers.
For this, we need to understand how a website is made.
To create a website, web developers usually use Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript. These languages are designed to work in conjunction with each
other.
HTML is used to create the physical structure of a website.
The physical structure contains elements such as text, links, images/videos, page dividers
and buttons.
The HTML code ensures a proper formatting of all text and image elements so that browsers
display the page consistently.
The back-end developer codes the structure of the website.
A website is like a house which has only been constructed.
Just like we need interior designers to add style to a space, we need front-end developers
to add the necessary glamour and appeal to a website.
When you order products from any website, you realize that the pages have a pleasing
font, attractive colours, and are easy to navigate.
Developers use CSS to create stylish websites.
CSS provides front-end developers with a standard method to define, apply, and manage different
sets of style characteristics for a website and each of its components.
CSS ensures uniformity in look and feel, style, colours, fonts, designs and layouts.
So, HTML is used to create the structure and CSS is used to design it and make it appealing.
CSS is also used to create websites that have cross browser compatibility which means that
they are compatible with multiple browsers and multiple devices such as PC, mobile devices,
iPads etc.
Online shopping websites are intuitive, interactive and quick to load. This is where
JavaScript comes into the picture.
JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that is used in conjunction with
HTML and CSS to add interactivity to a website.
For example, you use HTML to add a login button to a page, and CSS to style that button.
You then use JavaScript to add log-in functionality to that button.
A new front-end development language is Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS) called 
SAAS.
It is an extension of CSS that is compatible with all versions of CSS.
SASS enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, and inline imports to keep things
organized.
SAAS allows you to create style sheets faster and more easily.
Another language that is being used now is Learner Style Sheets (LESS) or LESS.
LESS enhances CSS, adding more styles and functions. It is backwards compatible with CSS.
Less.js is a JavaScript tool that converts the LESS styles to CSS styles.
Using all these languages, websites are designed as reactive and responsive.
Reactive or adaptive websites display the version of the website designed for a specific screen size.
For example, a website can provide more information if opened on a PC than when opened on a 
mobile device.
Responsive design of a website means that it will automatically resize to the device it is being 
accessed from.
For example, if you open up a products website on your mobile device, it will adapt itself to the 
small size of the screen and still show you all the features.
A JavaScript framework is an application framework that is written in JavaScript.
Programmers can manipulate the different functions, use them wherever required and can create
device responsive applications.
A few examples of several frameworks being used are:
Angular framework: an open-source framework and is being maintained by Google.
Angular frameworks allow websites to render the HTML pages quickly and efficiently.
It has built-in tools for routing and form validation.
React.js has been developed and maintained by Facebook.
It is a JavaScript library that builds and renders components for a web page.
It is not a complete suite of tools.
For example, routing is not a part of this framework and will need to be added using
a third-party tool.
React.js only helps build and drop components into a page.
Vue.js is maintained by the community and its main focus is the view layer which includes
user interface, buttons, and visual components.
It is flexible, scalable and integrates well with other frameworks.
It is very adaptable. It can be a library, or it can be the framework.
The task of a front-end developer evolves continuously.
The technologies are upgraded constantly and so front-end developers needs to keep
upgrading the websites that they create.
The websites that they create should work in multiple browsers, multiple operating systems
and multiple devices.

The Importance of Back-End Development

Welcome to the importance of back-end development.
A front-end developer creates websites and Cloud applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
to create what the user sees and interacts with in the client's software.
A back-end developer creates and manages all the resources that are needed to respond to
the requests that the user makes through the client.
The back-end developers tasks focus on enabling this server infrastructure or back-end to process 
requests, supply data, and provide other services securely.
Front-end and back-end developers must work together very closely.
Each needs to understand the requirements of the solution and how their respective parts will 
interact before the development process can begin.
Throughout the life cycle of the website or Cloud app, front-end and back-end developers 
collaborate to resolve issues and add functionality.
How does the work of a back-end developer affect you as you are browsing the Internet or using a 
Cloud App?
Think about it like this.
When you're shopping online, what happens to the data you enter?
Your login information, your product searches, your payment info.
The back-end processes all of these things.
The back-end developers write and maintain the parts of the application that process the inputs.
Let's think about your experience as you explore an online shopping site and make a purchase.
As you search for products, your search request is submitted to a web application, which then 
retrieves the data from a separate database and serves it back to the client for display.
To facilitate this, a back-end developer must understand the language that the web application uses,
how to query the database for the correct data, and how to bring the two together.
Even a simple task like navigating around the site can require the skills of a back-end developer.
Many sites have restricted areas that are only available to users who have an account and have 
logged in.
User account management, authentication and authorization can be the responsibility of the back-
end developer too.
Once you've decided what you want to purchase, you must add it to your card and make a payment.
The purchase process requires you to submit sensitive information such as your address and credit 
card number.
The back-end developer must ensure that this data is securely handled and stored.
Front-end client interactions, whether a request for data, like an image, accepting input from a user 
filling out a form, or securing sensitive information like a credit card number, all require different 
services from the backend server.
Each request needs to interact with the back-end in a different way.
Back-end developers use APIs, routes, and endpoints to process incoming requests.
An API is code that works with data, usually using JSON or XML.
APIs have set rules and structure.
A route is a path to a website or page that the user interacts with.
Routes generally take user input and show results based on the input and end point maybe an 
API or may simply be a path.
When a request from the front-end arrives at the back-end, it is routed to the correct service.
If the back-end has an endpoint defined for the request by using routing, the request will be 
addressed and replied to.
If the endpoint is missing, the server returns a 404 error.
Back-end developers must create and maintain this server side routing.
Along with back-end APIs, routes effectively allow the front-end client to plug into the correct 
socket at the back-end.
APIs provide a mechanism for Cloud apps, mobile apps, and other types of software to access 
resources from the back-end.
To perform all this back-end development, you will need to be familiar with at least one back-end 
language and its associated frameworks.
Among the most popular languages today is JavaScript, which was originally designed to run in 
web browsers, adding extra interactivity and dynamic content to web pages.
JavaScript is also being used on the back-end with new releases adding server-side 
functionality.
JavaScript has many frameworks, but two of the most well-known are Node.js and Express.
Python is another popular language.
It's very flexible and easy to learn.
Python has wide functionality.
It can be used for everything from creating webpages to connecting to a database, to performing 
data analysis.
Two well-known Python frameworks are Django and Flask.
Back-end developers often work with data and databases.
You will also benefit from learning some SQL.
To help handle requests from databases, back-end developers can use object relational mapping 
tools or ORM to connect to the databases and retrieve the correct data.
Although an ORM can hide some of the complexity of querying databases, it's useful to understand 
the fundamentals of databases so that you can troubleshoot any issues that arise.
The day-to-day tasks of a back-end developer focus on the behind the scenes functionality that 
keeps websites, Cloud apps, and mobile apps up and running.
Back-end development covers a wide range of technologies, from managing user accounts,
authentication and authorization to ensuring that sensitive data is stored and transferred securely.
Back-end developers also work with databases, retrieving, processing, and storing data as required.
Life for a back-end developer is very challenging and ever-changing.
Teamwork and Squads

Welcome to Teamwork and Squads.
After watching this video, you will be able to define teamwork and describe the advantages
of collaboration in software engineering and describe squads.
By definition, a team is a group of people working together towards a common aim.
Within a team, you'll find a range of different people with different skills, experience,
and talents.
Each person can give their attention and effort to the things that they are good at, and by
working alongside others on tasks outside their current repertoire, they can expand
their skillset.
Working in a team promotes creativity.
Collaborating with others gives you the opportunity to discuss ideas and challenge one another's
thinking about a subject.
Good teamwork is empowering: positive attitudes and behaviors can impact the rest of the team
and create positive results.
Working well as a team doesn't always come naturally, but there are some things you can
consider to help your team succeed.
Each member needs to trust and respect the other members of the team.
This generally comes with time, but depends on all of the members contributing equitably.
Defining and agreeing on goals for a project is essential so that the whole team knows
what they are working towards.
And you also need to define and agree on roles to avoid any duplication of effort or missed
tasks.
Working with each members strengths is important to make the most of the talent within your
team,
as is celebrating success and analysing problems.
Communication is vital in a team environment.
Ensure that you choose a method that works for everyone so you know that the whole team
is seeing and responding to information.
So, what does teamwork look like in software engineering?
Teams often start projects with a kick-off meeting where they plan how they will complete
the project, assign tasks, and agree on goals.
Throughout the lifetime of a project, you're likely to have whole team and/or sub team
meetings to review progress and plans.
Design and code reviews can be requested at the team level and undertaken by whoever has
availability at that point in time.
Team members might present walkthroughs of their sections of responsibility to the rest
of team so that the whole team has oversight of all parts of the project.
And, key team members will likely present walkthroughs to stakeholders at various times
during the project.
When a project is complete, retrospective meetings may be held to review what went well
and what could be improved in future projects.
You may have a mentor who may or may not be in your current project team. 	
You might also be asked to be a mentor.
Sometimes team mentoring is used so everyone can learn from each other.
Some groups also have teams working on internal projects such as defining coding standards,
maintaining or updating legacy cross-project code, or reviewing potential new software
for usefulness to the team.
Good teamwork can bring many benefits to a project.
Working alongside others can encourage creativity and enable you to take advantage of each 
person's
strengths while also allowing them to gain knowledge and skills from other members of
the team.
When working as part of a team, software engineers are more likely to adhere to corporate coding
standards and regularly document their code.
The additional accountability that teamwork creates results in better quality code, fewer
bugs, and more maintainable code.
From a software engineer's point of view, working as a team can reduce stress because
there's always someone to turn to and get help from.
And having someone to discuss problems with can help you to increase your understanding
and resolve more issues by yourself.
By working in a team, each member has a greater idea of the bigger picture, resulting in a
more coherent overall solution.
Some organizations that follow Agile development methodologies may call a team a squad.
Typically, a squad is a small team of up to 10 developers.
It is likely to consist of:
A squad leader who acts as the anchor developer and coach for the squad.
And a few software engineers who develop and implement the product features and test cases.
It may also include one or two user experience developers or designers.
In some squads the developers may work together in pairs to practice pair programming.
You'll learn more about pair programming in another video.
In this video, you learned that:
Software engineering teams meet regularly throughout the duration of a project.
Good teamwork encourages creativity, shares knowledge, and results in better quality code.
Squads are small teams used in agile development.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Teamwork in Software 
Engineering

Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Teamwork in Software Engineering.
In this video, we will hear from experts discussing how teamwork is important in software 
development,
and how teams work together.
Yeah, so teamwork is very, very important in the world of software development.
As a software engineer, you're not just going to be sitting at your desk coding all day.
One of the most important aspects of working on a team or on an engineering team is 
communication, and knowing how to collaborate and speak with your team members about the code 
you've written, especially if you're going to a UX designer, and say, Hey, here's what I can do.
And your spec is a bit off.
Can we massage your your specs a bit just so we can meet the code coding requirements.

Incredibly important, I while I think it's possible for a single person to engineer and deploy and run 
software, I, I think doing it as a team is both more impactful and gets you more potential to do 
bigger and greater things, I think it's also just a more fulfilling process, when you're when you're, 
you're building something with a group of individuals, I think, you know, with without the support 
structure, it's hard to build something and support it and maintain it just by yourself.

So teamwork, to me, is essential, because we're talking to each other all day.
And we're not only talking to our tech leads or senior engineer, we're talking to product
managers, we're talking to UX designers, we're talking to business analysts, we're talking
to data analysts, and so on and so forth.

You have the support system, you have diversity of opinions and perspectives in terms of how
you go about building it, it's more satisfying, you kind of can take larger risks, because you're, 
you're in it together, and you're there to support each other, I think the celebration of of a job well 
done is is a lot more, you know, it's a lot more fulfilling when you're when you're doing that with 
someone else.
But I think it just gives you both kind of a larger range of scope and a larger sort of risk portfolio, if 
you will, and you're able to, I think just, you know, get a lot more done a lot more checks and 
balances and really gives you you know, less likely, there's a less likely chance that you're gonna 
miss something, or you're gonna make a mistake, there's a lot of a lot of support there.

And so every project I've worked on has had at least three other people that I have needed to 
communicate with and support to be a reliable resource for them to go to them for questions.
Like I always have to be talking to somebody about something.
So teamwork is crucial.
Like, you can't, you can't work in an isolated silo forever, at some point, you have to talk to 
someone else.

Building a project product takes a lot of people, a lot of us come together to make a whole and to 
get the product shipped to production so our users can use it. And so teamwork is imperative.

Pair Programming
Welcome to Pair Programming. After watching this video, you will be able to describe pair 
programming and compare different styles and list the benefits and challenges of pair programming.
Pair programming is an extension of teamwork where two developers work side-by-side at
one computer.
They can either be physically at the same computer or work virtually via video link
or shared screens.
The former is the preferred option, but virtual pair programming can also be productive.
Pair programming is a type of Agile development where the two developers can plan and discuss
their ideas continually as they create a solution, generally resulting in a better end product.
There are various styles of pair programming: Driver/navigator style is the most common
style, where one developer is the driver, typing in the code, and the other is the navigator,
reviewing the code as it's written and giving directions where to go next.
The navigator also keeps an eye on the bigger picture of the overall solution.
When working in this way, it's important to regularly swap roles to keep both of the
pair engaged across the whole task.
Ping-pong style incorporates test-driven development.
For each task, one developer writes a failing test and then the second developer writes
code to pass that test.
For each new task, they swap roles, so regularly changing who writes the test and who writes
the implementation.
The two developers work together at the end of each task refactoring the successful code
to refine and improve it.
Strong style pair programming is a good way for junior software engineers to learn from
more experienced ones.
The defining rule for this is that for an idea to go from your head to the computer, it must go 
through someone else's hands.
So, the more experienced of the pair is the navigator and the driver learns from witnessing
their implementation and thought processes.
For this to work well, the driver shouldn't challenge any ideas until the full implementation
is complete so as not to interrupt the flow of ideas from the navigator. Now
pair programming has many benefits.
It's a good way to share knowledge and skills from one developer to another or between the
two and a great way for a new team member to get up to speed on a project.
As well as enhancing the technical skills of the pair, it's also a good way of building
soft skills such as communication and problem solving.
Having two sets of eyes on the code often results in fewer typos, logic errors, and
bugs.
And it enables code reviews to be done on the fly.
While this doesn't replace formal code reviews, it does enable another layer of review.
Having two people thinking about a problem can result in multiple initial ideas, but
is likely to result in the optimal approach being chosen earlier in the process.
And although pair programming can take longer than individuals writing the same solutions,
it's likely to result in better code with less time spent reviewing, testing, and bug
fixing.
There are also a few challenges to overcome.
Working in a pair requires long periods of focus which can be exhausting for the two
programmers.
And personal or other work commitments can impact the pair schedule.
Sometimes one of the pair can end up controlling the entire process, resulting in a more
typist/programmer pairing which doesn't benefit from any of the positives of pair
programming.
And at other times, individual personalities may not work well together.
When multiple sets of pair programmers are present, their discussions can result in a
noisy environment for the other workers in the room.

In this video, you learned that: Pair programming is an Agile development technique where two
developers work alongside each other.
There are multiple styles of pair programming.
And pair programming builds technical and soft skills, results in better quality code
and solutions, and increases overall efficiency.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Pair Programming

Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Pair Programming.
In this video, software engineers will discuss their experiences with peer programming and
share their thoughts about the benefits and potential challenges associated with this
way of working.
First, we'll begin by asking about their experiences with pair programming and about the benefits
they associate with it.
At every job I've ever had, there have come times where you pair up with someone else,
you get someone else sitting next to you at a computer, you're sitting next to them at
their computer, you're looking at a problem together, you're thinking about it.
Yes, I have actually, some of the benefits are definitely working with an engineer who
might be more of a senior engineer, because they have a lot of insight.
And they obviously have a lot of experience doing what you're probably trying to figure
out how to do.
And it's really great when it's someone who can both guide you but also kind of take take
a step back and not take over at the same time.

I think pair programming can can be very beneficial.
I think. If you're when you're working with someone together, it's an opportunity to learn I think
pair programming can be very great in circumstances where someone is new to a team.
New to a programming language, new to a set of tools, or a development environment that is new to 
them, sitting next to someone who's an expert, I think can both help you ramp up more quickly, it 
can help the the team itself, sort of understand where you are, in terms of your own knowledge and 
journey and help put you in a place to both succeed and utilize you in your skills as best as possible.
It does help you get real time feedback, you don't necessarily have to wait for code to be sent out to 
be reviewed, and you can kind of, you know, brainstorm together in real time on the actual 
implementation of it.

Ultimately, I try to keep in mind that the goal of pair programming is that everyone has inherent 
blind spots in the way that they think.
And that the way that they approach a problem.
And if you are talking to somebody else, they can point out what your blind spots are.
And they're going to have different blind spots than you as well.
So you can point out their blind spots.

What do you think are the drawbacks and challenges of pair programming?

I think that can be a con sometimes when you're working with another engineer and you're
trying to pair program with someone who kind of like takes over and then doesn't allow you to do 
your part or to learn especially if they kind of like already know how to do something.
So it's kind of like a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, you want to get that practical experience of practice of pair programming and you 
want to get that experience from someone else.
But at the same time, you want to make sure that you're learning.

I personally find pair programming to be a little frustrating.
Because the ways I go about solving problems can be very different than the ways other people go 
about solving problems.
And it's not that I have some special, unique, wonderful technique, it's just that everyone's brain 
works differently.
And watching someone else go through their workflow of how to solve a problem, they're not 
clicking the exact same buttons that you are. And that can get very frustrating to me.
It's like, why are you using your mouse because all those things, there's keystrokes or like, you 
could be doing this so much faster. And so I find it a challenge to do pair programming sometimes.

You actually need calendar time.
So you need to be able to dedicate time to sit together and work together and have an aligned 
schedule.
You both you can either be physical, could do it virtually, but you need to make the time to do it.
Peer programming, some can come with some overhead in terms of getting off the ground.
So if you have a tight time crunch, competing priorities, maybe just not enough, there might
be not enough time in the schedule to allow for it, that can be one of the cons.
That it can while you can get long term, I think efficiency benefits from you know, built, did writing 
the code together, because then support in the future will be easier because you have more people 
who know how the code was written and what the intent was. So there are definitely long term 
benefits. But there could be you know, some short term costs to it. So there are trade offs in that 
sense.

Introducing Application Development Tools

Welcome to Introducing Application Development Tools.
Getting your Cloud App from the ideas stage to fully formed, written, and deployed is
a long process, but there are many tools which will help you along the way.
A cloud application developer's workbench includes:
Version Control, Libraries, and Frameworks.
When many developers are working on the same project, knowing what order changes were made,
thereby creating a new version of the source code, becomes overweeningly important.
Version control systems keep track of what changes were made when and by whom and 
resolve any conflicts between changes.
For developing your code, version control can be useful even when you are the sole contributor
on a project.
Properly used, it can give you a way to revert to an older version of your code if something
goes wrong and gives you some basic information about how the code developed over time.
Version control functionality is generally tied to the storage system you are using, which is why a 
code repository is recommended, even for beginners.
Git and GitHub are extremely popular for source code storage and management.
Git stores files in repositories where you can track changes, split code into different branches 
for more focused development, and then merge them back into the main body of code.
Libraries are collections of code, like standard programs and subroutines, that you can use
within your code.
For example, you might want to include a navigational feature, like a carousel. A code library
can supply you with the code for that so that you don't have to spend the time and energy
creating one from scratch.
Being able to reuse code in this way makes developing your app much quicker and easier.
Multiple code libraries can be integrated into your existing project.
As you discover a need for a specific function or feature, you can research an appropriate
library.
You determine when to call the required method as needed, and control returns to the program
flow once the subroutine is finished.
When you use a code library, you are in control.
Code libraries are generally used to solve a specific problem or add a specific feature set.
Either way, there are lots for you to choose from, so do your research.
Here are some examples of code libraries:
jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies Dom manipulation.
Email-validator is a small library that checks an email address is correctly constructed
and valid.
Apache Commons Proper is a repository of reusable Java components.
Frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy applications.
You can think of a framework as being a skeleton that you can extend by adding your own code,
providing a scaffold on which to build your apps.
The framework you intend to use must be determined early in your development planning and used
right from the beginning.
New frameworks can't be incorporated into an existing project.
Your chosen framework dictates the architecture of your program and controls the program flow.
The framework determines which subroutines and methods will be called when. When working
with a framework, there is a specific structure that you must follow.
The framework is calls on your code, rather than you calling on the framework.
Frameworks are less flexible than libraries, allowing you less control, but they do provide good 
standardization and can help you create efficient code.
To use an analogy, if you are a carpenter building a house, the framework is the frame that you add 
to - bricks on the outside, plasterboard on the inside, and so on.
The frame acts as a guide for how the house is constructed.
Here are some examples of frameworks.
AngularJS is a JavaScript-based framework for dynamic web applications.
Vue.js is a JavaScript framework focused on the user interface.
Django is a framework that uses Python for web development.
Frameworks define the workflow that you must follow, unlike libraries, which allow you to 
call functions as and when required.
When using a framework, it can sometimes feel like you, as a developer, are not in full control 
of the development process.
This sense of the framework and its predefined workflow controlling the development process
is referred to as inversion of control.
Frameworks that have a lot of control are known as opinionated - they have opinions on how 
their workflow should be used and remove a lot of the decisions you would otherwise have to 
make about how code is written, the location of files, and even file names.
Frameworks often include their own libraries, which they call when needed.
Inversion of control allows you to create standardized apps, and takes away a lot of the 
tedious configuration work, so you can focus on the code for your app.

In this video, you've learned about some of the tools that you will utilize in your career as a 
developer including:
Version control, libraries, frameworks .


More Application Development Tools

Welcome to More Application Development Tools.
Let's look at some tools which can help you get your app built and deployed:
CI/CD, Build Tools, Packages, and Package Managers.
CI/CD refers to the practices of continuous integration and either continuous delivery
or continuous deployment.
CI/CD is a best practice for devops teams enabling developers to deliver frequent changes
reliably.
Implemented through a build-automation server, Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that all
the code components work together smoothly.
A CI build environment enables you to integrate newly developed code frequently, at least
every day, if not every hour, depending on how quickly the project changes.
Continuous delivery (CD) begins where CI ends. The CI process automatically builds and tests
your code, then CD deploys all code changes in a build to a testing or staging environment.
A build tool transforms your source code into the binaries needed for installation.
Build tools organize your source code, set compile flags, and manage dependencies.
They are most important in environments where there are many inter-connected projects, with
multiple developers contributing to each project.
In these environments it can be very difficult to keep track of what changes were made, in
what order, what dependencies exist, and what needs to be incorporated in the next build.
So automation is key to keeping everything running smoothly.
Build automation can automate a wide variety of tasks that developers do in their day-to-day
activities like:
Downloading dependencies.
Compiling source code into binary code.
Packaging that binary code.
Running tests and
deployment to production systems.
You can initiate a build from the command line or from an IDE.
There are two categories of Build Tools widely in use:
Build-automation utilities, which generate build artifacts like executables, by compiling
and linking source code.
Build-automation servers, which execute build-automation utilities on a scheduled or triggered 
basis.
Some examples of build tools are:
Webpack - a module bundler for JavaScript and
Babel - a JavaScript compiler.
Now that you have your app developed and tested, you're ready to deploy.
But how does that happen?
The app needs to be simple and trouble free for the user to install, so a commonly used
technique is to collect all the necessary files and bundle them together into a package.
Packages are archive files that contain the app files, instructions for installation,
and any metadata that you choose.
They have their own metadata too, including the package description, package version,
and any dependencies, like other packages that need to be installed beforehand.
Once you have bundled your app into a package, you can use a package manager to distribute it.
Package managers take care of the tasks of finding, installing, maintaining or uninstalling
software packages at the user's request.
Package management systems:
Coordinate with file archivers to extract package archives
Verify checksums and digital certificates to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the package
Locate, download, install, or update existing software from a software repository and
manage dependencies to ensure a package is installed with all packages it requires.
Some commonly used package managers for each of the major platforms are listed here:
On Linux - Debian Package Management System (DPKG) and Red Hat Package Manager 
(RPM)
On Windows - Chocolatey
On Android - Package Manager
On MacOS - Homebrew and MacPorts
Any libraries or utility code that is developed as part of the application is managed with the cloud 
application package managers.
Here are some examples of package managers for popular languages:
for Node.js/Javascript - npm
for Java - Gradle and Maven
for Ruby - RubyGems
for Python - Pip and Conda

In this video you've learned about some of the tools that you will utilize will support
you in your career as a developer , including:
CI/CD, Build Tools, Packages and Package Managers.

Introduction to Software Stacks

Welcome to Introduction to Software Stacks.
After watching this video, you will be able to describe software stack terminology, identify some 
commonly used software stacks, and list the benefits and challenges of different software stacks.
A software stack is a combination of technologies that includes software and programming 
languages. Developers use a software stack to create applications and solutions such as web 
and mobile apps. The set of individual technologies is stacked in a hierarchy and work 
together to support the execution of an application. The higher levels in the stack provide tasks 
or services for the user and the lower levels interact with the computer hardware.
Software stacks typically include:
Front-end technologies such as programming languages, frameworks, and user interface tools.
And back-end technologies such as programming languages, frameworks, web servers, app 
servers, operating systems, messaging applications, and databases.
You might hear the term technology stack used in place of software stack. However, a technology 
stack is a broader term that includes hardware and infrastructure like virtual machines, containers, 
storage, and load balancers, as well as the software stack.
The simplest implementation of a software stack consists of a presentation layer, a business 
logic layer, and a data layer. However, more complex applications use more complex stacks, 
which could include software for virtualization, scheduling and orchestration, runtime 
environments, database connectivity, networking, and security.
The software and services that make up a stack can be from a variety of sources:
from internal resources, to third party providers, to cloud providers.
There's no formal definition of the structure of a stack, the only rule being that the software and
services included must support an application's development, functionality, or deployment.
When you're using a software stack, you don't have to use all of the available layers, you only need 
to use those which are relevant to your solution.
There are many different examples of software stacks, The Python-Django stack, uses the 
popular Python programming language alongside the Django web framework. This 
combination is all open source and commonly used for large-scale, fast-changing web applications.
The Ruby on Rails stack, uses the Ruby programming language with a server-side web 
application framework. Ruby on Rails is great with JSON or XML for data transfer and 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development.
And the ASP.NET stack includes Microsoft technologies such as the ASP.NET MVC 
framework, the IIS web server, SQL Server, and Azure.
You'll learn more about the LAMP, MEAN, MEVN, and MERN stacks next.
The LAMP stack runs on the Linux operating system. It uses the Apache HTTP or Web server,
MySQL databases, and the PHP programming language. LAMP is an example of an early
incarnation of a software stack designed for building websites and cloud applications.
All its constituent parts are open source and loosely coupled, so it's easy to swap
different options into the stack. For example, you could choose to use PostgreSQL instead of
MySQL for your database server, changing the LAMP stack to be the LAPP stack.
Similarly, you could use the Python programming language instead of PHP.
The MEAN stack uses a MongoDB database with an Express.js web application server framework,
the Angular.js framework for front-end JavaScript development, and the Node.js platform for 
server-side scripting.
The MEAN software and services are platform agnostic, free, and open source.
There are other stacks related to the MEAN stack, including:
The MERN stack which replaces Angular.js with React, and is a flexible and high-performing 
framework for developing front-ends.
And the MEVN stack which replaces Angular.js with Vue.js. Vue is a lighter-weight JavaScript
framework with less capabilities, but it can provide better performance than Angular.js.
Let's consider some advantages and disadvantages of three different software stacks:
MEAN, MVEN, and LAMP.
MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack used for building web applications. The
biggest advantage of the MEAN stack is that all of the parts use JavaScript, so developers only need 
to know a single language. The stack is also open source which means the cost is lucrative to 
businesses and there is a lot of documentation and re-usable code for developers to use. 
Development
can happen quickly because Node.js has a huge collection of free, reusable module libraries.
However, the MEAN stack may not be well-suited for large-scale applications.
When using Express.js, the business logic often resides on the server preventing the reuse
of some services like batching operations. And MongoDB is great for unstructured data, but it 
doesn't provide the same level of functionality as a relational database.
The MEVN stack is a web stack like MEAN, but it uses Vue.js instead of Angular.js for user 
interfaces.
MEVN and MEAN stacks have similar advantages, but Vue.js is a much newer technology and 
doesn't have as many reusable libraries as Angular.js. Like MEAN and MEVN, the software and 
services in the LAMP stack are open source meaning there are lots of reusable chunks of code 
available to the developers. And because LAMP is one of the oldest software stacks it's easy to find 
support and reusable solutions. However, because the Linux operating system is an integral part of 
the stack, it isn't as flexible as MEAN and MEVN which are platform agnostic. MySQL is a 
relational database, so the stack cannot take advantage of unstructured data. The other disadvantage 
of the LAMP stack is that the back-end runs on PHP, Perl, or Python, whereas the front-end uses 
JavaScript and HTML, making it harder for developers to switch back and forth than the MEAN 
and MEVN stacks which use JavaScript throughout.


In this video, you learned that:
Software stacks are a combination of technologies for creating applications and solutions.
Software stacks can range from simple three-layered systems to many layers.
There are numerous types of software stacks for different developers and environments.
The biggest advantage of the MEAN stack is that all of the parts use JavaScript, so developers only 
need to know a single language.
And, the LAMP stack on Linux works well for relational data.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Tools and Technologies

Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Tools and Technologies. In this video, we will hear from experts 
discussing their favorite tools and technologies for software engineering projects.
Our team uses Git and GitHub every single day for all of our projects.
We use it for tracking code. We use it for collaboration and we use it for tracking bugs, features, and 
tasks for all of our projects.
I believe most open source projects are now using Git. Every project I've contributed to, whether 
open source or closed has used it gets true value is most apparent when you're working on a team 
with multiple people, at which point you'll be glad to have things like feature branches and pull 
requests. But even if you are working on a project where you're the sole committer, I recommend 
using Git, and in particular GitHub for the Community aspect So if you are a front end developer, if 
you understand JavaScript and picking up back in using a framework, like Node JS is not that much 
of a stretch, actually started building, you know, static websites, and then slowly learned how to 
how to put in dynamic content using JavaScript. And then I had to use Java, or PHP to build my 
back end systems in on the server.
For front end development, you're primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you're very front 
end focused, you might want to try out an ID built for that specific purpose, such as brackets if you 
want to keep things more general, I recommend VS. Code.
In either case, I recommend installing IDE extensions for automatic formatting and linting
of your code. By using prettier and eslint these will help you catch issues as early as possible
for back end development the tools are quite a bit more varied so it's hard to give specific 
recommendations. But if you choose node JS, you'll be able to use some of these same tools that I 
mentioned for front end development. Otherwise, I recommend just looking into what IDE 
extensions are available and what linters and auto formatters are available JavaScript is a very 
powerful language. It lets you do pretty much anything you can imagine, including shooting 
yourself in the foot if you're not careful.
The practices I typically follow with JavaScript include proper scoping of variables and functions.
And writing unit and integration tests for my features.
React JS was developed at Facebook very popular. Angular is a framework operated by Google that 
allows for development of single page applications. SPA's jQuery is possibly the most popular and 
oldest library out there, created by John Resig in 2006,
and jQuery is frequently used with both Angular and React. Backbone is a lightweight JavaScript
library that is very popular in terms of back end languages and frameworks.
Node.js is an open source server side platform built on the Google Chrome JavaScript engine.
It uses an asynchronous single threaded architecture that allows it to serve a very large number of 
concurrent connections. Flask is a framework used on Python that is popular with Pythonistas and 
the Spring framework based on Java has been around for years and remains popular
We use React JavaScript framework it is better than Angular in terms of speed and efficiency.
React is easier to learn than other JavaScript frameworks, which makes its adoption in the team 
easy. It also resolves, it also resolves the problems related to cross browser issues.
Another great feature of React is the use of JSX. JSX is helpful when working with UI
inside the JavaScript code. It helps react to show more useful error and warning messages.
My favorite front end JavaScript framework would be React JS, I love the whole component driven
design and architecture that you have then that you have to follow when you create a React JS based 
application. I also like the idea of, you know, props and states to hold your, the state of your 
application.
By using Express JS for back end development, we are able to scale applications quickly.
We can code both front end and back end with the help of JavaScript easily by using Express JS. 
Express JS is supported with the Google V eight engine with the help of which you will be able to 
get higher performance without any lag or error in processing.
It also supports the caching features, so you would not have to re execute the codes again and again. 
Moreover, moreover, it will help web pages to load faster than ever When working with Node.js, 
I'll, I'll give you two of my favorite packages that I use on a daily basis. So first is making requests 
to web services.
I use a library like Axios, that helps me create these requests with the right headers, and also 
provide me with callback functions and or promises to be able to handle the responses that come 
back.
My second package would be when I'm working with databases, I'll use NPM packages, more likely 
than not to talk to an external database, regardless of if it's, if it's a relational database, or a no SQL 
database.
So in writing JavaScript, I really like to take advantage of the features. And yes, six, because
it can make my code look cleaner, easier to read, and, and just more beautiful, such as the arrow 
functions, or the dot dot dot operator. And so I encourage you to, after learning JavaScript, dive into 
ESX a bit and have fun with it.

Basics of Programming
Programming Languages and 
Organisation

Interpreted and Compiled Programming 
Languages

Welcome to interpreted and compiled programming languages!
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Identify interpreted programming languages, and identify compiled programming languages.
What are programming languages?
Programming languages help us tell computers what to do.
Computers don't use human language; they use their own language, called machine code.
Machines understand binary code, that is 1s and 0s.
So, to make communicating with computers easier, we have human-readable programming 
languages.
Two common categories for programming languages are:
Interpreted and compiled.
These are broad categories, and there are many programming languages that are classified
under compiled languages and interpreted languages.
The purpose of the project helps a developer determine which programming language is best.
Interpreted language is also commonly referred to as scripted or scripting language.
Programs written in interpreted or scripted language, like Python and HTML, run through
the programming interpreter on your computer's operating system or in your web browser.
Remember that programming languages are in human-readable code,
so, the interpreter takes the human-readable scripted code and then translates it into
machine code, enabling the computer to complete the requested task.
As computers and web pages have changed and advanced, some interpreted programming 
languages are outdated, and they are not as useful or relevant .Some other languages are more 
versatile and easier to learn, which means they are preferred over other scripting languages and used 
more often.
All interpreted programming languages need an interpreter to translate the source code.
Translators are built into your web browser or they require a program on your computer
to translate the code.
Several different interpreted programming languages exist.
Some examples of common interpreted programming language types are:
• JavaScript, a simpler scripting language that runs through the web browser interpreter
• Python, a language that is popular because it is easy to learn and use for developers
• Lua, a general purpose, lightweight game scripting language that is easy to learn and
use
• HTML, a markup language used for formatting web pages .
Another category of programming languages is the compiled programming languages.
Compiled programs are applications and programs, like your music app or your operating system,
that you run on your computer or device.
The programs are packaged --or compiled-- into one executable file.
They are usually larger programs.
Compiled programs are used to help solve more challenging problems, like interpreting 
source
code.
Compiled programming languages are often referred to more simply as programming 
languages.
A compiler program creates a program file, which runs the software.
Simply put: It piles the code into one file that runs when you double-click on the app
on your device.
The program runs faster and it can be done repeatedly.
The source code is converted from the programming language to machine code.
Then it is compiled into one executable file.
Finally, the program runs when you select the icon or file on your device.
Some examples of compiled programming languages are:
C and its variations C++ and C#, which are used in many operating systems, like Microsoft
Windows, Apple's macOS, and the open-source operating system Linux.
Java is another compiled programming language.
It shouldn't be confused with the interpreted language JavaScript.
The Android OS is written in Java because it works well across computing platforms.
Let's look at this process:
When you update to a new version of your operating system, like Microsoft Windows, your device
might download an installation program.
That program is made up of many files.
The files are written in a compiled programming language.
These files give instructions to your device in machine code.
The compiled program is running on your device.
A compiled program that you commonly use is your device's operating system, such as
Linux, Microsoft Windows, Apple's macOS, or Android.
Your operating system is written in a compiled programming language, like C, C++, C#, or
Java.

In this video, you learned that:
Interpreted programming languages run scripts that are repetitive and need to be run often.
Interpreted programming languages are more versatile and can be used across platforms
as long as there is the correct interpreter.
Some examples of interpreted programming languages are JavaScript, Python, and HTML.
Compiled programming languages are for more complex programs that complete larger tasks.
Compiled programming languages are used for creating executable files that can run directly
from your device.
And some examples of compiled programming languages are C and Java.

Comparing Compiled and Interpreted 
Programming Languages

Welcome to Comparing Compiled and Interpreted Programming Languages!
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Compare interpreted and compiled programming languages,
And discuss interpreted and compiled programming languages.
How do developers choose a programming language?
Developers choose which programming language is best to use depending on:
What they have the most experience with and what they trust, What is best for their users, And what 
is the most efficient to use.
What are interpreted and compiled programming languages?
Interpreted programming languages are used to create a scripted source code for smaller
tasks.
The source code goes through an interpreter.
The interpreter is built into the operating system on a computer or on a web browser.
Compiled programming languages are used to create files.
The files are executable files.
They are then grouped in programs that you run on a computer or device.
are used to automate tasks.
Interpreter programs read and execute the source code, line by line, like someone would read a 
script.
Each time the program runs, the source code needs to be executed to receive the desired output.
And source code written in one of the interpreted programming languages runs on almost any 
operating system with the right interpreter.
For example: Imagine you have a client requesting information about webpage views for last 
month.
Which type of programming language would be the most appropriate and efficient to create
a program for this task?
You would use one of the interpreted programming languages to write code for a script.
The script would retrieve the webpage views data and then put it into a table for the client to read.

Compiled programming languages are also called programming languages for short.
They are used for more complex programs that complete larger tasks, like running a spreadsheet
program on your computer.
A compiled programming language is used to write a larger program, usually installed on your 
device as an executable file.
Writing code in a compiled language does take longer, but the payoff is that the program's
code runs faster because compiled programs are installed on the device.
And once the program is coded, the compiled program is grouped into one downloadable file.
Remember that client who wanted information about webpage views?
Now they want a spreadsheet program to view and manage the data.
A programmer could use the C programming language to create a compiled program, like Microsoft
Excel.
So what are the major differences between interpreted programming languages and compiled
programming languages?
First, there's interpreted programming.
These programs are available across multiple platforms or in the cloud.
The scripting languages are easier to learn and use. And they're better for websites because they 
tackle smaller, repeated processes.
Then there's compiled programming.
These programs are available to users with the same operating system coded in the same
language. However, compiled programming languages are more difficult to learn and use because 
they are larger programs with more parts. And they're better for larger tasks, like running the 
operating system on your computer.
To better understand more of the similarities and differences of programming languages, let's take a 
look at some examples.
A few of the most common programming languages are C, C++, and C#.
C is a compiled programming language.
C is the original language, and C++ and C# are variations.
C and its variations are case-sensitive languages.
The C programming language is the basis for Windows and other common operating systems.
And it takes more time to learn and use for coding but requires less memory and the code runs 
faster.
Another common programming language is Java.
It is a compiled programming language.
It is also a case-sensitive, object-oriented programming language.
The Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, is required to run the code written in Java.
It is the primary programming language for some operating systems like the Android OS.
And a benefit of Java is that it is a cross-platform language, which means it runs the same code
on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
Python is an example of an interpreted programming language. It is also referred to as a scripting 
language. Python is a popular general-use, case-sensitive programming language.
It is used with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems and with server-side web app code.
And it requires the Python engine to interpret code.
JavaScript is another interpreted programming language. It is a scripting language that runs on the 
client side in web browsers. JavaScript is case insensitive. Simple scripts are run with HTML.
Complex scripts are run in separate files.
And while it sounds similar, it shouldn't be confused with Java, the compiled programming
language.
Another example of a common programming language is HTML.
It is an interpreted programming language.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
HTML is mostly case insensitive, with some exceptions.
And it uses tags to format web pages on client-side web browsers.

In this video, you learned that:
Interpreted programming languages create source code that runs through an interpreter in 
your
device's operating system or on your web browser.
Compiled programming languages create executable files that are grouped in programs on 
your
device.
Compiled programming languages like C and Java are used to write larger programs like
operating systems and other executable files.
And interpreted programming languages like Python and HTML are used to write code that
can complete repetitive tasks within a web browser or a computer.
Query and Assembly Programming Languages

Welcome to "Query and Assembly Programming Languages."
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Compare high-level and low-level programming languages.
Describe query languages.
Describe assembly languages.
Let's explore query and assembly programming languages.
But first, we need to categorize programming languages
into two levels - high-level and low-level.
A high-level programming language is
more sophisticated and
uses the common English language to make its code more understandable
and to increase the speed of coding and debugging programs.
Examples of high-level programming languages include query languages
such as Structured Query Language (or SQL), structured programming languages such as Pascal,
and object-oriented programming languages such as Python.
In contrast, a low-level programming language
uses a set of symbols to represent machine code.
And examples of low-level programming languages include assembly languages
such as ARM, MIPS, and X86.
A query is a request for information from a database.
The database handles the query and searches its tables for the information requested
and returns the results to the querying entity.
When querying a database, it is important that both the user application making the query
and the database handling the query are speaking the same language.
In programming terms, writing a query means using predefined
and understandable instructions to make the request to a database.
This is achieved using programmatic code and this is what we refer to as a query language.
A query language may also be referred to as a database query language.
By far the most prevalent query language for database queries and database management is SQL.
However, there are other query languages available
such as AQL, CQL, Datalog, and DMX.
In addition to SQL databases,
there is another type of database called NoSQL, which stands for Not Only SQL.
The key difference between these two types of databases is their data structures.
While SQL databases are relational
and use structured, predefined, schemas,
NoSQL databases are non-relational in nature
and have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
A query language is predominantly used to request data from a database
or to create, read, update, and delete data in a database. You will likely see the term
CRUD used to refer to these last four key database operations.
Typically, a user enters a command to either make a query or perform a CRUD operation using 
syntax
that is understandable to the database management system hosting the database.
And a database typically consists of structured tables made up
of multiple rows and columns of data.
When a user performs a query,
the database retrieves the data from the relevant rows and columns in the table and
arranges it into some sort of order,
ready to be returned and presented in the query results.
Database queries are either
a select command,
or an action command, such as CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, or a mixture of both.
The term "statement" is more commonly used to describe these commands.
Select queries request data from a database,
whereas action queries manipulate data in a database.
Query statements can also be used to perform other administrative functions
such as creating users and modifying permissions.
This table lists some of the most common SQL query statements.
Here are some simple syntax examples of common SQL statements.
As mentioned earlier, assembly languages are less sophisticated than query languages,
structured programming languages, and object-oriented programming languages.
As an assembly language uses a simple set of symbols to represent the 0s and 1s
of machine code, it is categorized as a low-level programming language.
Assembly languages are closely tied to the processor architecture from hardware manufacturers
and therefore, each CPU type will typically have its own assembly language.
For this reason, there are a large number of assembly languages in use today,
which vary among hardware manufacturers.
Assembly languages use a simple readable format for their statements,
and they are entered one line at a time,
with one statement per line.
Assembly language statements use the standard format shown here.
In this syntax all fields in curly brackets { } are optional,
and the statement has two main parts.
The first part is the instruction (or the mnemonic),
and the second part includes the parameters (or the operands).
There may also be optional useful comments added on the end of the statement.
One other key difference with assembly languages
is that they are translated using an assembler instead of a complier or interpreter,
and one statement translates into just one machine code instruction,
as opposed to high-level languages where one statement can be
translated into multiple machine code instructions.
Assemblers translate assembly language into machine code using mnemonics
such as Input (INP), Output (OUT), Load (LDA), Store (STA), and Add (ADD).
The statements consist of opcodes that tell the processor what to do with the data,
and operands that tell the processor where to find the data.

In this video, you learned that:
Query languages, structured programming languages,
and object-oriented programming languages are categorized as high-level programming languages.
Assembly languages are categorized as low-level programming languages.
A query language is predominantly used to request data from a database or to manipulate data in a 
database.
The most prevalent query language for database queries and database management is Structured 
Query Language (SQL).
Select queries request data from a database, whereas action queries manipulate data in a database.
You also learned that:
Assembly languages use a simple set of symbols to represent the 0s and 1s of machine code.
Assembly languages are closely tied to the processor architecture from hardware manufacturers.
Assembly languages are translated using an assembler instead of a complier or interpreter.
And assembly language instructions
have a one-to-one association with their machine code counterpart.

Understanding Code Organization Methods

Welcome to Understanding Code Organization Methods.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain why code organization methods are important when programming.
Define the different code organization methods
and identify the benefits of using code organization methods.
Organizing is very important when it comes to reading, maintaining, and configuring code.
Well-planned-out software design, usually using one of several methods, helps programmers write 
cleaner and more reliable code.
Planning out code in a visual format helps improve the code base once it is written and reduces the 
chance of bugs and errors throughout the lifespan of a project.
Organizing code before programming has a positive impact on the quality of the program and helps
provide a consistent and logical format to use while coding.
There are two main methods of organizing code: flowcharts and pseudocode.
The main difference between pseudocode and a flowchart is that the former is a basic, high-level 
description of an algorithm.
An algorithm is a step-by-step sequence of solving a given problem.
A flowchart is a pictorial representation of an algorithm showing the steps as boxes of various 
shapes and colours connected by arrows that indicate their order.
Flowcharts are used in designing or documenting a process or program.
Pseudocode provides a beneficial bridge to the project code because it closely follows the logic that 
the code will.
Pseudocode also helps programmers share ideas without spending too much time creating code, and 
it provides a structure that is not dependent on any one programming language.
Flowcharts are especially beneficial for smaller concepts and problems, while pseudocode is 
more efficient for larger programming projects.
And flowcharts provide an easy method of communication about the logic and offer a good starting
point for the project because they are easier to create than pseudocode in the beginning stages.

A flowchart is the graphical or pictorial representation of an algorithm using different 
symbols, shapes, and arrows in different sizes and colours to demonstrate a process or a 
program.
The main purpose of using a flowchart is to analyse different methods of solving a problem or 
completing a process.
Several standard symbols are applied in a flowchart, and you can easily highlight certain elements 
and the relationships between each part in the process.
Some traditional flowchart shapes used for programming concepts are:
Start/End (a capsule),
Process (a rectangle),
Decision (a diamond),
Data (a parallelogram),
And Connecters (as arrows).
A simple flowchart to represent how to add two numbers is easy to create.
The procedure starts with the capsule, and has a connector, or arrow, progressing to the next step, 
the data input (the parallelogram), in this case, input n1 and input n2.
Then, another connector, or arrow, goes to the process (the rectangle) of adding the two inputs, Sum 
= n1 + n2.
Another connector, or arrow, moves to the data (the parallelogram) showing the results, in this case, 
Print Sum.
The last connector, or arrow, moves to the end of the process, the end capsule.
Flowchart software is an application that provides various functionalities to create
flowcharts by providing the ability to drag shapes into the desired order using an easy-to-use
editor.
Flowchart software also provides team collaboration for creating flowcharts.
Some of the well-known flowchart software programs include:
Microsoft Visio,
Lucidchart,
Draw.io,
And DrawAnywhere.

Pseudocode is an informal type of programming description that does not require any strict
programming language syntax or underlying technology considerations.
System designers write pseudocode to ensure that programmers understand a software project's
requirements and align code accordingly.
Pseudocode is used for creating an outline or a rough draft of a program that summarizes a 
program's flow but excludes underlying details.
Pseudocode acts as the bridge between the programmer's brain and the computer's code executor 
that provides the ability to plan instructions that follow a logical pattern, without including all the 
technical details.
Pseudocode is a great way of getting started with software programming as a beginner without
worrying about coding syntax.
Pseudocode helps both programmers and non-programmers agree about the program's goal and the 
basics of how the task should be done.
Here's one example of pseudocode written to check if the user entered an odd or even
number:
The next example displays the pseudocode written in C++:
There are many advantages of using pseudocode over flowcharts.
The main benefit of pseudocode is that it's simple and explains exactly what each line
of an application should do.
The coder can focus more on logic than on program language syntax.
Removing the distractions of coding when using pseudocode makes the code development stage
easier.
Words and phrases in pseudocode represent lines of basic computer operations that simplify
translation from the pseudocode algorithm to the specific programming language.
Pseudocode allows programmers working in different computer languages to interact with each 
other.
Pseudocode can be reviewed by different development groups easier than real code.
Pseudocode is easier for non-programmers to read and enables quick and easy translation
to any computer language.
Writing pseudocode is more concise and easier to modify, so changes to the design can be
easily incorporated.
And lastly, unlike some flowcharts, pseudocode is usually less than one page.

In this video, you learned that:
Organizing and planning out software design enables programmers to write cleaner and more
reliable code, and organized code is very important from a readability, maintainability,
and scalability standpoint.
Two main methods of organizing and planning software code are by developing flowcharts
or writing pseudocode.
A flowchart is a pictorial representation of an algorithm showing the steps as boxes
of various kinds connected by arrows that indicate their order.
And the main goal of pseudocode is to explain exactly what each line of a program should
do, making the code construction phase easier for the programmer.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Types of Languages


Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Types of Languages.
In this video, we will hear from experts discussing if they prefer developing in compiled or 
interpreted programming languages.
most of the time, it doesn't really matter.
It just comes down to personal preference, like what are you going to get moving on the
fastest.
there are certain situations where it will make a difference, if you're compiling ahead of time versus 
interpreting on the fly, if you're trying to eke out, like very small, incremental performance benefits,
I prefer compiled code or compiled language that's compiled language just because I have a more of 
a guarantee that it will well maybe not necessarily work, but we'll do what I thought it will do.
And at least we'll deploy properly.
When when when being rolled out.
but usually not, it doesn't, doesn't make that much of a difference to either the development
process or the like deployment and use process.
There.
They, they definitely have advantages and disadvantages to each of them.
But most of the time, doesn't make that much of a difference to what I'm doing.
I think, interpreted languages can you know, there's a lot of like flexibility there.
And often you can do more creative things.
And then you know, the compiler, it's sort of stops, the buck stops with the compiler, and you can't 
really avoid compiler errors with the compiled language with interpreted there's more interesting 
runtime possibilities there.
So I think it really depends on what environment you're developing for, or what your your risk
factor is, when it comes to being okay with, with potentially buggy code being out in the
wild.
What do you think are the benefits of object-oriented programming over procedural 
programming?
Anything can be an object.
And object-oriented design puts hierarchies and patterns onto those things.
And that structure can make it easy to keep designs in mind.
And keep in mind how the different objects interact with each other.
It's also very easy in object-oriented programming to paint yourself into a wall where you have
put too much structure around everything.
And you now have this like explosion of useless boilerplate code.
So there's a bit of a, not catch 22.
But just a balance that you need to find in between how much structure should your thing
have?
How much flexibility should it have?
And how much should your intentions be imposed on that design and the way that people interact
with it,

I think procedural programming can be, you know, feels more mathematical and more sort of, like 
pure engineering, in some sense.
And I think that that also can lend itself well to someone who is really looking to not just build 
software, but really wants to sort of feel like they're engineering the code, in some sense.
It can feel like you're, you're kind of like, in the machine if you will.
So, I know that's a weird answer.
But it's, it's I think it doesn't, you know, depending on how your brain works to one can
lend itself more easily than the other.
So, but I love I think it's worth trying them both out.
if you get super object-oriented, you can get a little to a little too prescriptive with the designs, I 
think.
So that's just whenever you're using objects, it's just a thing to keep in mind that you can go, you 
can go too far with it.
But where that line of too far is kind of depends on exactly what it is that you're building, 
sometimes there, sometimes the sky's the limit, just regulate everything.
And sometimes the amount of flexibility that you require actually does mean that you can't really 
have an object of any sorts.
Most of those situations should be pretty weird, those would be on the extremes.
But most of the time, a few simple objects will do a lot of good, no matter what the rest of your 
system looks like.

Yeah, I think object-oriented programming to me is, for me, personally, I think it does lend itself 
well to like real-world mappings and data models.
And, you know, the sort of classic examples of you might, in your first object-oriented software, 
demo builds something like a library that has books, and it has a checkout.
So, like you get there's physical objects that the way you learn it is very much sort of you think 
about the software as something real worlds that helps you make the jump from building something 
physical with your hands to building something with, with bits and bytes.

Programming Logics ans 
Concepts

Branching and Looping Programming 
Logic

Welcome to Branching and Looping 
Programming Logic.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the two types of programming logic
Define Boolean expressions and variables
and list the differences between branching and looping.
There are two major types of programming logic: branching and looping. Both types use Boolean
expressions and variables:
A Boolean expression is a type of programming statement with only two values, either "true"
or "false."
And variables have assigned values that are passed into a function or subroutine within
a more extensive program.
Computers use Boolean logic to make decisions. The computer takes one action if a Boolean
expression is true and a different action if the expression is false.
Typically, a program consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do and data that
the program uses when it is running. A variable has a value that can change, depending on
conditions or information passed to the program. Boolean logic, along with variables, form
the basis of programming.
Branching logic is where a computer program makes a decision following a different set
of instructions, depending on whether certain conditions are met during the program's execution.
Each possible code pathway creates another branch. The branch of code that runs depends
on the values assigned to the parameters of the branching procedure. There is no limit
to the number of branches to implement complex logic.
The values of these parameters may be input by the user or generated by the output from
a previous procedure.
Branching contains constructs that occur and are processed to determine the path a program
takes when running.
Branching statements (also known as constructs) allow the execution flow to jump to a different
part of the program. The common branching statements used within other control structures
include:
if,
if-then-else,
Switch,
and GoTo.
The if statement is a decision-making construct that guides a program to make decisions based
on specified criteria. The if statement executes one code set when a specific condition is
met (TRUE) or another code set if the condition is not met (FALSE).
The if-then-else is a conditional construct that executes its sub statement, which follows
the "then" keyword. This only occurs if the provided condition is true.
The if-else statement extends the "if" statement by specifying an action if the
"if" (true/false expression) is false. With the if-else statement, the program will
execute either the true code block or the false code block, so something is always performed
with an if-else statement.
In computer programming languages, a switch statement is a type of selection control
mechanism used to allow the value of a variable or expression to change the control flow of
program execution via search and map.
GoTo is a statement found in many computer programming languages that performs a one-way
transfer of control to another line of code. In contrast, a function call typically returns
control.
Now, let's look at the logic of looping programming. A loop is a sequence of instructions
that continually repeats until reaching a specific condition. Typically, a particular
process is performed, such as retrieving and changing data, and then some conditions are
checked, such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number. If it has not, the next
instruction in the sequence is to return to the first instruction in the series and repeat
the sequence. If the condition is reached, the next instruction "falls through" to the
next sequential instruction or branches outside the loop. A loop is a fundamental programming
idea commonly used in writing programs.
There are three basic loop statements:
While
For
And Do-while.
In a While loop, a condition is evaluated before processing the body of the loop. If
a condition is true then and only then the body of a loop is executed.
In a For loop, the initial value is performed only once, then the condition tests and compares
the counter to a fixed value after each iteration, stopping the For loop when false is returned.
In a Do-while loop, the condition is always executed after the body of a loop. It is also
called an exit-controlled loop.
In this video, you learned that:
There are two major types of programming logic: branching and looping. Both types of logic
use Boolean expressions and variables.
Boolean expressions have only two possible values, either true or false, and variables
have assigned values that are passed into a function or subroutine within a more extensive
program. Variables have values that can change, depending on conditions or information passed
to the program.
And branching is deciding what actions to take, while looping is deciding how many times
to perform a certain action.

Introduction to Programming Concepts 
Part 1

Welcome to Introduction to Programming 
Concepts - Part 1.

After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the purpose and use of identifiers in programming.
Describe the purpose and use of containers in programming.
To fully understand software programming, there are some fundamental programming concepts you 
need to know first.
The first concepts you will look at are identifiers.
Software developers use an identifier to reference a program component such as a stored value, a 
method, an interface, or a class, by assigning a custom-named label to it.
If the identifier stores data, then the data values in the program can be one of two types:
either a constant, or a variable.
A constant is a data item whose value does not change within a program.
This could be a numerical constant such as the mathematical value of Pi, or it could be a text string 
that remains constant such as a player's name within a game.
Constants are also referred to as 'named constants.'
You assign a value to a constant when you define it.
For example, you might want it to refer to a numerical value within your program such as Pi, or a 
cost price, or a rate of tax, and then, rather than repeatedly retyping the same numerical value, you 
can just declare a constant for that value instead, and name it something meaningful like 'pi_value', 
or 'cost_price', or 'tax_rate'.
There are a couple of major benefits to using constants in your programs; one is for ease of 
readability in your code, and the other is that if the specified value changes in the future, you only 
need to change it once on the constant, rather than finding every instance of that numerical value 
within your code and changing it.
The other type of identifier used in programming is a variable.
As the name suggests, this kind of identifier is not constant; its value can change during the 
program's execution, such as a user entering their age in an application or a high score in a 
game.
Variables can be strings of text, numerical values, or any other type of data.
Using a variable as an identifier is a useful way to refer to program items that are unknown to you,
such as a username, a service, or a file name for instance.
If you don't use a variable, then you will need to hard code
all the names and values in your program, which is not considered best practice.
Variables can be declared and assigned a data type and initial value as they are defined, or you can 
decide not to assign an initial value when you define a variable, and instead have the value assigned 
later by instructions within the program.
In addition to the identifier data structures already discussed, there are also special kinds of 
identifiers that can reference multiple elements in a program, and these are referred to as 
containers.
Being able to specify multiple elements means that you don't have to create a variable for every 
individual element.
This makes it faster and more efficient.
For example, if you only want to store six numerical integers, then you could argue that you could 
just create six variables, one for each.
But what if you need to store 1,000 integers or more? In such a case, defining 1,000 variables would 
obviously be an unwieldly and inefficient programming technique, so in this case you would use a 
container.
There are two types of containers to specify multiple elements: arrays and vectors.
The simplest of these container types is an array.
In an array, a fixed number of elements of the same type are stored in sequential order, starting from 
index zero.
When you declare an array, you specify the data type of the values it contains, such as an integer, or 
boolean, or a string, and then the maximum number of elements it can contain.
The syntax for declaring an array is to specify the data type first, then the name of the array, then 
the maximum size of the array in square braces.
In contrast to arrays that have a fixed size, vectors have a dynamic size, and they will 
automatically resize themselves as you add elements to them or remove elements from them.
For this reason, you may also see them referred to as dynamic arrays.
Because they are dynamic in nature, vectors take up more memory space than arrays,
and their elements also take a little longer to access than elements in an array, as they are not 
stored in sequential memory locations.
The syntax for declaring a vector is to specify the container type of the vector first, then specify the 
data type in angle brackets, then the name of the array. Note that because it is a vector, you do not 
need to specify a maximum number of values it can contain because the size is not fixed, it is 
dynamic.

In this video, you learned that:
Software developers use an identifier to reference a program component.
If an identifier stores data, then it can either be a constant or a variable.
A constant is a data item whose value does not change within the program.

Welcome to Introduction to Programming 
Concepts - Part Two.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe the purpose and use of functions in programming,
and describe the purpose and use of objects in programming.
Next, let's look at the fundamental concept of functions.
Functions are a consequence of the modular programming software development methodology
that encourages the separation of a program into multiple modular components, where each 
performs a specific task within a program.
So, a function is essentially a piece of structured, stand-alone, and reusable code that will perform a 
single specific action.
This enables software developers to take a substantial, complex program and divide it into smaller,
more manageable, and focused pieces.
Although some programming languages may refer to them as something else,
such as subroutines, procedures, methods, or modules, most modern programming languages refer 
to them as functions.
Functions take in data as an input, then process the data, and then return the result as an output.
There are essentially two types of functions.
Standard library functions are the built-in functions provided by the programming language.
Common examples include the 'If', 'Else', 'While ' and 'Print' functions.
But programming languages also allow you to write your own functions.
And once you've written a function, you can use it over and over again.
The way that the blocks of code that make up a function are identified is different across 
programming languages.
Some use braces, some use begin and end statements, and others use indentations for example.
There are a few steps to using functions.
The first thing you need to do is define (or create) a function.
When you define a function, you provide a function keyword, then give the function a unique name,
and you provide the statements that make up the body of the function.
Once a function has been defined, it then needs to be called (or invoked).
When you call a function, the specified actions within the function are performed using any 
specified parameters.
While defining and calling functions are common to all programming languages, some 
programming languages, such as C and C++ , also require you to declare a function.
Next, let's look at the concept of objects.
Understanding what objects are is key to understanding object-oriented programming.
Object-oriented programming (or OOP) is a programming methodology that is focused on objects 
rather than functions, which is what procedure-oriented programming is focused on.
The objects themselves will contain data in the form of properties (or attributes) and code in 
the form of procedures (or methods).
The key distinction between the two methodologies is that where procedural programming uses 
methods to operate on separate data structures, OOP packages them both together, so an object 
operates on its own data structure.
Consider the real-world objects in your life such as your car, bike, TV, or your washing machine,
and ask yourself the following two questions:
"What states can the object be in?" and
"What behaviors can the object perform?"
When you think about your answers to these questions, you will find that the answers to these 
questions vary across the objects.
More complex objects will typically have more potential states they can be in and will be able to 
perform more behaviors.
In programming, a software object is similar to a real-world object, conceptually speaking,
in that they too consist of states (or properties) and behaviors (or methods).
Software objects can be anything, such as a Windows service, a user account, a database table, or a 
system folder.
Objects store their properties in fields (referred to as variables in some programming languages),
and expose their behaviors through methods (referred to as functions in some programming 
languages).

In this video, you learned that:
• A function is a piece of structured, stand-alone, and reusable code that
will perform a single specific action.
• The defining and calling of functions is common to all programming languages.
• Object-oriented programming is a programming methodology
that is focused on objects rather than functions.
• Software objects consist of properties and methods.

Summary & Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know: 
•	Interpreted programming languages create source code that runs through an interpreter and 
is built into your operating system (OS) on your computer or on your web browser. 
•	Compiled programming languages create executable files that are grouped in programs on 
your computer or device.  
•	Query languages, structured programming languages, and object-oriented programming 
languages are categorized as high-level programming languages and assembly languages are 
categorized as low-level programming languages.  
•	The two main methods of organizing and planning code are by developing flowcharts and by 
writing pseudocode. Flowcharts are pictorial representations of algorithms and pseudocode 
is an explanation of the function of each line of a program. 
•	To reference a program component, software developers use an identifier, which can either 
be a constant or a variable.  
•	A function is a piece of structured, stand-alone, and reusable code that will perform a single 
specific action.  
•	Object-oriented programming is a programming methodology that is focused on objects 
rather than functions.  
Introduction to Software Architecture

Welcome to Introduction to Software Architecture.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe what software architecture is;
Explain the importance of well-designed software architecture;
Explain how software architecture impacts design decisions such as tech stacks and production
environments; and list several artifacts from software architecture design.
Software design and documentation take place during the design phase of the SDLC.
Software architecture, simply put, is the organization of the system.
Software architecture serves as a blueprint for the software system that the programmers use 
to develop the interacting components of the software.
The architecture comprises the fundamental structures of a software system and explains the 
behaviour of that system.
The architecture defines how components should interact with each other, the operating  
environment, and the principles used to design the software.
The software architecture captures early design decisions that are often costly to change once 
implemented.
A software's architecture addresses non-functional aspects of the application such as 
performance, scalability, maintainability, interoperability, security, and manageability.
Well-designed software architecture is important for a number of reasons.
First, it balances the differing needs of the stakeholders and serves as a basis for communication 
among team members.
Next, the architecture represents the earliest design decisions, and those decisions conflate
other coding implementation decisions later in the development process.
Also, the well-designed architecture allows for agility due to changing requirements.
A well-organized architecture increases the lifespan of the software system even when 
implementation details change.
Architectural design also guides the choice of technology stacks used for the system.
Remember that architecture addresses non-functional capabilities so choosing stacks that address
these requirements is paramount in the design phase.
Recall that a tech stack is a list of all the technologies including software, programming
languages, libraries, and frameworks that will be used to create the system.
The architects must be aware of the stack's advantages and disadvantages to anticipate
development needs.
Much like blueprints communicate design decisions to the builders of a house, there are also
several artifacts produced during the architectural design phase that are used to communicate
the software design to the stakeholders.
These artifacts include a software design document, or SDD, an architectural diagram, and 
unified modeling language, or UML, diagrams.
The SDD is a collection of technical specifications that indicate how the design should be 
implemented.
It provides a functional description of the software and design considerations such as 
assumptions, dependencies, constraints, requirements, objectives, and methodologies.
The architectural diagram displays components, their interactions, their constraints, and their 
confines.
It displays the architectural patterns used in the design.
Architectural patterns are general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems and
will be discussed in more detail in an upcoming video.
UML diagrams are diagrams that communicate structure and behavior using common 
programming language agnostic notation.
UML diagrams will also be discussed in more detail in another video.
Another topic to be discussed in this module as it relates to software architecture includes
production deployment considerations.
The architecture drives choices about the environment in which the software is released.
The production environment is comprised of the infrastructure that runs and delivers
the application to the end-user such as the servers, load balancers, and databases.

In this video you learned that:
Software architecture functions as a blueprint and represents the underlying organization
of the application.
A good architectural design is important because it serves as a basis for communication among
team members.
Software architecture represents the earliest design decisions, is hard to change once development
starts, and accommodates changing requirements during development.
Architectural design influences technology stack choices and the production environment
and Artifacts resulting from the design include the SDD, the architecture diagram, and UML
diagram.
Software Design and Modeling
Welcome to software design and 
modeling.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Compare and contrast the terms "structured design" and "behavioural models."
Describe Unified Modeling Language (or UML) and its advantages when designing software.
And, discuss the purpose of an interaction and a state transition diagram.
Software Design is a process during which structural components and behavioural attributes 
of the software are documented before it can be developed.
One of the key activities of the design process is modeling the software to express its design.
This involves creating visual or diagrammatic representations of the bigger software solution, and 
its sub-components, as well as the interactions between them.
This can be done using simple flowcharts or more standardized methods like UML.
A software system can be construed in terms of structural elements. Structured design 
conceptualizes a software problem into well-organized smaller solution elements called modules 
and sub-modules.
Structured design stresses organization in order to achieve a solution. A well-structured design 
should contain modules that are cohesive and loosely coupled.
Cohesion means that all functionally related elements are grouped together.
Coupling is the communication between different modules. For a system to be loosely coupled
the modules should be weakly associated so changes in one component have minimal effect on 
another. Loose coupling is an architectural principle often used in service-oriented 
architectures and microservices based architectural patterns, which will be discussed later in 
the module.
The diagram shows a simplified example billing system. Modules are arranged in a hierarchy and 
communicate with each other.
The rectangles represent the modules and sub-modules.
You can see that "billing" is the main module, and the other rectangles are sub-modules to the main 
billing module. In this example the sub-modules are "insurance verification," "submit claim," and 
"output total."
The arrows represent the flow of the data in the system.
Behavioural models describe what a system does, without explaining how it does it.
The overall behaviour of a system can be communicated through behavioural models.
There are a number of different UML diagrams that can be used to communicate the behaviour
of a system. We will discuss two such diagrams, a state transition diagram, and an interaction 
diagram.
When developing a complex software system with interconnected modules, it can be difficult
to remember the relationships, behaviors, and hierarchies among different elements.
UML, which stands for Unified Modeling Language, is a way to visually represent the architecture,
design, and implementation of complex software systems. UML is a standardized modeling 
language that can be used throughout development processes.
UML diagrams can be divided into two classes: either structural or behavioral. UML is 
programming language agnostic, so software developers can readily interpret and apply it to 
their work no matter which language they are developing in.
There are several advantages of using UML to communicate architecture, behaviour, and 
structure with development teams. The biggest advantage of UML diagrams is that they allow 
you to plan out features before any coding takes place which saves time and money. Secondly, 
the diagrams can be used to bring new team members or developers switching teams to get up 
to speed quickly.
Also, the diagrams can be used to facilitate communication between technical and non-
technical audiences more easily.
And finally, having a visual representation of the system allows developers to navigate the source 
code because they can see the relationships among modules. There are many types of UML 
diagrams but generally, UML diagrams can be classified as either behavioural or structural.
We will discuss behavioural models next and then object oriented-design.
The behaviour of a system can be explained and represented with the help of a UML diagram
called a state transition diagram. The state transition diagram is a collection of states and events 
that describes the different states that a system has and the events which cause a change of state in 
the system. The diagram shown is an example of a state transition diagram that models a patient 
going to see a doctor at a clinic. The different states include
"waiting,"
"testing," and
"with the doctor." The arrows represent possible transitions from one state to another and names the 
event that triggers the transition.
An interaction diagram is used to model the dynamic nature of a software system. They help 
visualize objects and their relationships. A sequence diagram, which is the type of interaction
diagram shown here, displays the communication between objects with respect to time. This
example shows a patient making an appointment in an online portal. This is another example of a 
behavioural UML diagram.

In this video you learned that:
Structured design breaks down a software problem into well-organized smaller solution elements.
Behavioural models describe the behaviour of the system without explaining how the system
implements the behaviour.
Developing UML diagrams saves time and money by helping developers quickly get up to speed
on a project, plan features in advance of coding, and help developers navigate source
code easily.
A state transition diagram is a behavioral model containing a collection of states and events that 
describe the different states of a system and the events which cause a change of state.
And finally, an interaction diagram describes how interacting objects communicate.
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design
Welcome to object-oriented analysis and design.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain what objects and classes are.
Describe the purpose of a class diagram, and explain object-oriented design in relation to software 
architecture.
Object-oriented analysis and design, or OOAD for short, is an approach for analyzing and
designing a software system when the system will use object-oriented programming languages to 
develop it.
So, before we discuss OOAD, let's learn a little more about object-oriented programming
in languages like Java, C++, or Python.
At the heart of OOAD are objects.
Objects contain data, and they also have behaviors that prescribe the actions the object can
take.
I could create an object for example, that represents a patient.
Let's say the patient's name is Naya Patel and Naya needs to cancel an appointment she
made.
Before creating Naya, however, we must first create a generic version of a patient object.
The generic version of an object is called a "class".
Let's discuss classes next before we discuss more about Naya.
Specific objects, also called instances, are created from "classes" which are blueprints or templates 
for an object.
So, from our previous example, considering Naya Patel, Naya would be an instance of the
patient class.
The class contains the object's generic attributes - the properties and methods - but it is only when 
the object is created, which is called "instantiation," inside the code that these generic attributes are 
set to particular values.
So, the patient class might have a variable called LastName, which is a property but does
not specify what that last name is.
LastName is just a placeholder until that object is created and assigned a name.
Once the object has been instantiated its methods can be called to make the object perform
some action such as making or cancelling an appointment.
OOAD is used for a system that can be broken down into objects that interact with each
other.
In this way, multiple developers can work on different aspects of the application at the same time.
As noted earlier, visual UML diagrams can be created that show both the static structure and 
dynamic behaviour of a system.
We've seen a couple of examples of behavioural UML diagrams already, so now let's look
at a structural UML diagram called a "class diagram" next now that we know what classes
are.
This is an example of a "class diagram."
Class diagrams are commonly used to communicate a software system's structure in OOAD.
The class diagram shows how the classes in an object-oriented design relate to one another.
Each box represents a class and shows its attributes.
Recall that an object's attributes are both its properties or its data, and its available actions, called 
methods.
A class diagram also shows the relationships between classes.
A subclass is said to "inherit" its parent class attributes meaning it has the same properties
and methods as the parent class but also may add additional properties and methods.
In this diagram, the nurse, doctor, and technician classes are subclasses of medical personnel, and 
the specialist class is a subclass of the doctor class. This means that doctors can do anything 
medical personnel can do and specialists can do anything a doctor can do.

In this video you learned that:
Object-oriented analysis and design is the process of planning a software system based
on the behaviours of interacting objects.
Objects contain data, and they also have behaviours that prescribe the actions the object can
take.
Classes are blueprints for objects.
A class diagram is a structural UML diagram that shows the relationship between objects.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Importance of 
Design and Software Architecture
Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: The 
Importance of Design and Software 
Architecture.
In this video, we will hear from experts discussing the importance of design and software 
architecture in a software engineering project.
Design and architecture are crucial.
If you don't know where you're going, how do you know what you need to do now?
You always need to know what you should, what your program needs to be prepared to handle,
and the system that it's operating within.
If you are running a series, if you're running a bunch of applications that are all co-hosted
on the same server, you can make certain assumptions about the ways those services can interact
with each other that do not hold.
I also sometimes think of architecture and orchestration.
So you can you can have like a beautiful, really nice sounding instrument.
But if it's not in sync with the rest of the orchestra, it's going to sound like a complete
cacophonous mess in the end.
So you really need to think about the bigger picture.
Sustainability, whether you're, you know, what you're building actually makes sense
in the larger sort of ecosystem.
And every time if you spend the time to write your code, and then you figure out why it
doesn't work, you've wasted a lot of time writing that code, maybe you've learned some
things, it's not a total waste.
But you've spent a lot of time that could have been spent moving forward.
And so if you can think about those things ahead of time on a project.
And then when you write your code, you're reasonably sure that the code you write is
actually going to persist and get used, that's generally speaking a better place to be in.
So architecture is very important.
like there's a lot of talk about its scale, global availability, often something you build
would work very well in a very hyper local environment, but not work well, when it's
expected to be used across the globe or, you know, works well for one user, but doesn't
work well, for a million users.
I'm building as a service, I need XYZ pieces of data to come into the function that
I want to write.
Where are those things coming from?
How are they getting passed in?
Once I have them what do I need to do with them?
What else needs to access this data?
And how am I going to get the data to those other parts also?
If you don't have those questions answered, you end up writing a lot of churny code.
If everything is on a separate server somewhere in the cloud, or separate physical servers
that are just located somewhere different inside your data centre, then you have to
incur a network hop to go over them.
And that takes time, your page might start timing out and your customers might get really
upset at you for how long things take.
And so, if you're building something in like a microservice architecture, the way that
you load your data becomes much more important than if everything is hosted together on the
same server.
But maybe the question of who is using my service?
How do I know who you are?
That can become an interesting question, depending on where your servers where your services
are running, and what mechanisms are available to you to identify people.
If your people if you want your customers to log into a website, how are you doing account
management?
How do you know who that person is and what they're allowed to do?
Or if you have multiple services talking to each other again, how do you know what that
service is?
What it's allowed to do?
How do you make the call between one and the other?
How do you transmit data between different parts of your stack?
So architecture is very important. It doesn't always have to be super well defined, super
strictly defined, but you need to have some idea of what what things do you need, roughly
where they're going to live.
And what things what are they responsible for?
Those would probably be the three big questions to ask, what, where and scope of them?

So these sorts of concepts, you know, you have to think about those things.
When you're designing or architecting a system, you're thinking like, 5, 10 years ahead to
when you're thinking about architecture and design, you're not thinking about just building
something quickly, in getting it up, you actually want to plan ahead.
So I think a lot of architecture and design is thinking about, you know, how the how many
steps, how many years, whatever in the future, you know, what is it going to look like then?
What do you need to do to keep growing the system and evolving it?
Because you know, you don't want to make gigantic architecture changes that often, you know,
you don't really use when buildings are repaired, they there's like, tiny bits of things get
repaired.
And then at some point, you tear the thing down and rebuild it.
And I think that's a similar model applied to sustainable system architecture, you don't
want to re-architect and redesign every few years, you want it to last as long as you
possibly can.

Patterns and Deployment 
Technologies

Approaches to Application 
Architecture
Welcome to Approaches to Application Architecture.
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe component-based architectures and service-oriented architecture.
Explain the characteristics of a component.
Differentiate between components and services.
And, describe the characteristics of distributed systems.
A component is an individual unit of encapsulated functionality that
serves as a part of an application in conjunction with other components.
There are six characteristics of components. Components should be
reusable,
replaceable,
independent,
extensible,
encapsulated, and
non-context specific.

Let's briefly discuss each of these principles.
Reusable implies that components should
be designed such that they can be reused in different applications.
Replaceable means that a component should be easily replaced with another component.
Independent means the component should be designed so it doesn't
have dependencies on other components.
Extensibility entails the ability to add behaviour to a component without changing other 
components.
Encapsulation consists of bundling a component's data and methods to hide its internal state,
so it doesn't expose its specific implementation.
Creating a component that is non-context-specific involves designing it so it operates in different
environments. Data that sets its internal state should be passed to the component rather than 
included within or accessed by the component.
Let's take a look at some examples of components.
An API can be packaged as a component, if it can be reused across multiple systems and 
applications.
For instance, a component could be an open-source
API that connects a system to a particular database.
A component can also be the interface for a database, called a data access object, that
switches the user to a different database without the application knowing about the switch.
A controller is a type of component that determines which other components need to
be called for a particular event. It controls the flow of data between two other components.
Component-based architecture, then, focuses on the decomposition of the design into these 
logical components.
Component-based architecture provides a higher level of abstraction than object-oriented designs.
A component-based architecture should define, compose, and implement loosely coupled 
independent components so they work together to create an application.
A service is like a component, also a unit of functionality, but it is designed to be deployed 
independently and reused by multiple systems.
A service focuses on a solution to a business need.
A key difference between a component and a service is that a service will only have one unique,
always running instance with whom multiple clients communicate. This diagram displays
the relationship between objects, components, and services in a layered architecture.
Services are made of components and components consist of objects.
A service is a type of component. It is meant to be deployed independently of the overall system.
Examples of services include:
checking a customer's credit,
calculating a monthly loan payment,
or processing a mortgage application.
In a service-oriented architecture, or SOA, services are loosely coupled and interface with 
each other via a communication protocol over a network.
SOA supports building distributed systems that deliver services to other applications through the 
communication protocol. So, let's discuss distributed systems next.
A distributed system is a system with multiple services located on different machines that
coordinate interactions by passing messages to each other via a communication protocol such 
as hypertext transfer protocol, also known as HTTP.
Even though the services on a distributed system operate on multiple machines, a distributed system 
appears to the end-user as a single coherent system.
A distributed system shares resources such as hardware, software, and data.
They are fault-tolerant, meaning if a node or a service fails the system continues to run also 
implying that the system may change during execution without service interruption.
Multiple activities run concurrently on a distributed system reducing latency and increasing 
throughput.
Another property of distributed systems is that they are scalable as the number of users increases. 
The computers running the distributed system do not need to use the same kind of hardware or 
operating systems.
A distributed system may be made up of different kinds of computers and programming languages.
A node is any device on a network that can recognize, process, and transmit data to other nodes on 
the network.
A distributed system consists of multiple interconnected nodes where the nodes are running one or 
more services in an SOA.
Distributed systems generally use one or more of the following basic types of architecture:
client-server,
three-tier,
peer-to-peer or
microservices. These application architectures and their characteristics will be discussed in another 
video.
In this video, you learned that:
Components are reusable, independent, replaceable, extensible, encapsulated, and non-context 
specific.
Component-based architecture is the decomposition of the system into logical independent 
components.
Services are made of components and components consist of objects.
Services are deployed independently and can be reused by multiple systems.
In an SOA services are loosely coupled and interface with each other via a communication protocol 
over a network.
And lastly, distributed systems run on multiple services on different machines and they appear to 
the end-user as a single coherent system .

Application Deployment Environments

Welcome to architectural patterns in 
software!
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Describe different software architectures such as 2-tier, 3-tier, peer-to-peer, event-driven,
and microservices.
Provide an example of each architectural pattern.
An architectural pattern is a repeatable solution to a problem in software architecture.
Patterns highlight common internal elements and structures of a software system.
Different architecture patterns may share related characteristics.
In this video, we will discuss
2-tier,
3-tier,
peer-to-peer,
event-driven, and
microservices.
However, there are many other patterns that will not be covered in this video.
These patterns include
model-view-controller,
message-broker,
blackboard,
pipe-filter, and
controller-responder.
The 2-tier architecture, also called client-server, is a computing model in which the
server hosts, delivers, and manages most of the resources and services
delivered to the client.
The interface resides on the client machine and makes requests to a server for data or
services.
This type of architecture usually has more than one client computer connected to a server 
component over a network connection.
A 3-tier architecture, or an n-tier architecture when there are more than three layers, is the most 
common software architecture.
The 3-tier architecture is composed of separate horizontal tiers that function together as a single unit 
of software.
A tier only communicates with other tiers located directly above and below it.
Related components are placed within the same tier.
Changes in one tier do not affect the other tier.
The 3-tier architecture organizes applications into three logical and physical computing tiers:
the presentation tier, or user interface
the middle tier which is usually the application tier, is where business logic is processed
the data tier, where the data is stored and managed
The peer-to-peer architecture, or P2P for short, consists of a decentralized network of nodes that are 
both clients and servers.
The workload is partitioned among these nodes.
Peers make a portion of their resources directly available to other network participants, without
the need for central coordination by servers.
Resources are things like processing power, disk storage, or network bandwidth.
Peers both supply and consume resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server
architecture in which the consumption happens strictly by the client and the servers, supply
the resources.
Peer-to-peer architecture is useful for file sharing, instant messaging, collaboration, and high-
performance computing.
An event is anything that results in a change of state.
An event can be thought of as an action that is triggered by the end-user, such as a mouse click, or 
another part of the program.
Event-driven architecture focuses on
producers and
consumers of events.
Producers listen for and react to triggers while consumers process an event.
The producer publishes the event to an event router.
The router determines which consumer to push the eveto.
The triggering event generates a message, called an event notification, to the consumer
which is listening for the event.
The components in event-driven architectures are loosely coupled making the pattern 
appropriate
for use with modern, distributed systems.
Microservices are an approach to building an application that breaks its functionality
into modular components called services.
An application programming interface, also called an API, is the part of an application
that communicates with other applications.
An API defines how two applications share and modify each other's data.
APIs can be used to create a microservices-based architecture.
The API Gateway routes the API from the client to a service.
Orchestration handles communication between services.
Let's discuss an example for each of these patterns.
A text messaging app is an example of a 2-tier pattern.
The client initiates a request to send a text message through a server and the server responds
by sending that message to another different client.
Another example of the 2-tier pattern, is Database clients connecting with database servers.
Many web apps use the 3-tier pattern.
They use a web server to provide the user interface, an application server to process user inputs, and 
a database server that handles data management.
The functions of these three types of servers will be discussed in more detail in another video.
Ride-sharing apps such as Lyft and Uber are examples of event-driven patterns.
The customer sends a notification that they need a ride from a particular location to another 
location, and that event is routed to a consumer.
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum use a peer-to-peer pattern.
Each computer in the blockchain acts as both server and client.
Finally, social media sites are composed of microservices.
A user has an account.
That account can request different services such as adding friends, targeted ad recommendations,
and displaying content.
Architectural patterns are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
In other words, two or more of these patterns can be combined.
For instance, a three-tiered architecture can also be microservice-based, or a peer-to-peer 
architecture can also be event-driven.
However, not all architectural patterns can be used in conjunction with others.
A peer-to-peer cannot also be two-tier because a single machine in a peer-to-peer architecture
represents both a client and a server whereas a two-tier architecture separates the client from the 
server.
It is up to the system architect to determine which architectural patterns the software system should 
adhere to.

In this video, you learned that:
An architectural pattern is a repeatable solution to an architectural problem
A 2-tier pattern has a client and server.
Text messaging apps use a 2-tier pattern.
A 3-tier pattern has 3-tiers that interact with each other.
Web apps use a 3-tier pattern.
An event-driven pattern has actions that are produced and responded to by a consumer.
Ride-sharing apps use an event-driven pattern.
The peer-to-peer pattern consists of a decentralized network of nodes that act as clients and servers.
Cryptocurrency is an example of the peer-to-peer pattern.
Microservices are loosely coupled individual services that behave as a single system and
interact with the client.
Communication is orchestrated among services.
Social media sites are an example and Two or more patterns can be combined in a single system but 
some are not mutually exclusive

Application Deployment Environments
Welcome to Application Deployment Environments. After watching this video
you will also be able to:
List different types of pre-production environments and state their purpose.
Differentiate a production environment from other application environments.
And compare and contrast deployment options.
An application environment is the combination of the hardware and software resources required
to run an application.
This includes: the application code and/or binary executables for its various components or modules
the software stack it requires for running the application such as modules and libraries it depends 
on, third party applications and middleware, and the operating system, any networking components 
and infrastructure, as well as any physical or virtual hardware including computing or processing 
resources, memory, and storage. There are a variety of environment types depending on the 
application's stage in the lifecycle.
The pre-production environments are those platforms that the application resides on in various 
forms as it gets prepared for production. Common pre-production environments are "development," 
"QA," which stands for quality assurance, and "staging."
The development environment is the platform on which the application is being actively 
coded, and in many cases it may just be the developer's workstation.
The QA environment, sometimes called "testing" is the environment that allows the QA team
to test the application's components.
The staging environment is the environment that is as close to replicating the production 
environment as possible but is not meant for general users. Now, let's discuss the production
environment.
The production environment, often just called "production" includes the
entire solution stack consisting of both hardware and software on which the application runs
as additional infrastructure components.
The production environment is intended for all users.
Unlike the pre-production environments, this robust environment must take the application
"load" into consideration because it is the environment intended for general use, possibly by 
thousands or millions of people at the same time for enterprise-level applications.
Production environments must also take into account non-functional requirements like 
security, reliability, and scalability.
This makes the production environment more complicated than the pre-production ones.
Now, let's take a look at the production environment infrastructure.
There are several options for deploying application environments.
In on-premises deployment, the system and its infrastructure reside in-house, within the 
organization's physical location, often behind a firewall. Firewalls prevent unauthorized access to or 
from a private network.
If an organization desires greater security or control of an application and the data in use by that 
application, it may deploy the application on-premises.
For on-premises software deployments, an organization is responsible for the system, hardware, 
related infrastructure, and maintenance required to run the application.
On-premises deployment is usually more expensive when compared to cloud deployment. Let's
discuss cloud deployments next.
There are three types of Cloud deployment models-public, private, and hybrid.
The public cloud is when you leverage the software's supporting infrastructure over the open 
internet on hardware owned by the cloud provider. That hardware and the associated services are 
shared with other companies. Public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), 
Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and IBM Cloud. The public cloud is the most common 
due to its scalability and cost.
With a private cloud, the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single 
organization. The software system can be run on-premises, or the infrastructure could be owned, 
managed, and operated by a service provider. For example, AWS is also a private cloud service 
provider. The main advantage of a private cloud is increased security, but it also allows for more 
flexibility because it can be fully customized.
A mix of both public and private clouds, working together seamlessly, is called a hybrid cloud
model. A hybrid cloud potentially optimizes the advantages of both public and private cloud models 
with regard to cost, security, scalability, and flexibility.

In this video you learned that:
Application environments include: development, testing or QA, staging, and production.
Production environments must also take into account non-functional requirements like load, 
security, reliability, and scalability.
And application environments can be deployed either on-premises on traditional hardware, or on
public, private, or hybrid cloud platforms.

Production Deployment Components

Welcome to production deployment components.
After watching this video you will be able to:
Describe components commonly required for deployment in a production environment.
Describe the purpose of a firewall and a load balancer.
And differentiate between different types of servers.
Let's consider an n-tier architecture required to deploy an application in a production environment
and represent the infrastructure using a diagram.
The top tier is the presentation tier which contains the front-end client applications.
All of the other tiers are located behind a firewall.
Firewalls and the other components mentioned in this diagram will be discussed in further
detail later in the video.
The next tier is the web tier which has a web load balancer that distributes incoming
traffic to several web servers.
The tier below the web tier is the application server tier.
This tier contains an app load balancer or a proxy server that routes traffic to different
application servers.
The bottom tier is the data tier that contains the database server.
A high availability replica of the database is often also used to ensure reliability.
Some environments may have additional components or tiers.
Also not all of these components are necessary for every deployment. For example, in some
environments there might not be a need for both application servers in addition to web
servers.
Now, let's look at these components in further detail.
A firewall is a security device that monitors traffic between networks.
It permits or blocks requested data based on a set of security rules.
It acts as a barrier between networks to block viruses, malware, and hackers from accessing
the internal network.
The purpose of load balancers is to distribute network traffic efficiently amongst multiple
servers, called a server farm, on a network.
Load balancers are used to prevent server traffic overload and are located between clients
and the servers.
A load balancer determines which servers are capable of fulfilling those requirements in a
manner that maximizes availability and responsiveness.
Load balancers ensure that no one server is overworked.
They manage concurrent requests from clients and return the correct data in a fast and
reliable manner.
Web and application servers are either software or machines that provides services, resources,
data, or applications to another computer program, called the client.
Servers store, process, and manage network data, devices, and systems.
A web server delivers content such as web pages, files, images, and videos to a client.
A web server primarily responds to hypertext transfer protocol requests coming from a web
browser such as a user accessing a website.
An app server is a server that runs business logic and provides the application to the
client rather than the client running the app on their own machine.
Its primary job is to enable interaction between the end-user and the server-side application
code. The application code represents the business logic that determines how data can be created,
stored, and changed.
That logic dictates things like transaction results and what data is written to and retrieved
from a database.
A proxy server is an intermediate server that sits in between two tiers and handles requests
between those tiers.
A proxy server can serve multiple purposes such as load balancing, system optimization,
caching, acting as a firewall, obscuring the source of the request, encryption, scanning
for malware, and more.
A proxy server can improve the efficiency, privacy, and security of data flowing through
a network.
A database is a collection of related data, stored on a computer that can be accessed
in various ways.
A database is usually controlled by software called a database management system or DBMS.
The DBMS controls a database by connecting the database to users or other programs.
The database server controls the flow and storage of data.
The DBMS connects the database server to an application so data stored in the database
can be retrieved or manipulated by the application.

In this video you learned that:
Common components needed for a production environment include a firewall, a load balancer,
web and application servers, proxy servers, and database servers.
A firewall is a security device that monitors traffic between networks.
A load balancer distributes network traffic amongst servers.
A web server delivers content such as web pages, files, images, and videos to a client.
An application server runs business logic and provides the application to the client
rather than the client running the app on their own machine and finally,
a database server stores and controls the flow of data through a database management
system.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Deployment 
Architecture

Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: 
Deployment Architecture.
In this video, we will hear from experts discussing
important aspects of software deployment.
I think often you need to think about scale, like this sort of just in general, is your system, how 
many users your system has?
How much data do you expect to flow through it?
How much data do you expect to produce and store?
How real-time do you need the data access to be?
What is your logging story like? Do you have privacy concerns?
Do you need to ensure that data is anonymized?
So you kind of, I think, thinking about the scale, the region-ality, is it global?
Is it local?
What is your logging?
What are your logging needs, both for internal and external
data analysis, mapping out the data flows?
So these are sort of the things I think we start with is with design principles.

And in terms of choosing infrastructure, like whether you want to go serverless, whether you want 
to use a hosted back end, and you're hosting your own, you know, these are all design and 
architectural decisions, that will probably, for your first few jobs, already be taken for you.

What's your system SLOs, your availability look like? Service level objectives, right? So, you need 
to think about those sorts of things, I think, ensuring you, you have you like, what does a healthy 
system mean to you?
What does a well-running system mean to you need to define those metrics upfront?
And sort of have those monitored, and, you know, watch those as, as your system lives on and,
and make sure that you're meeting those objectives and goals and have a plan to mitigate them
if they fall below where you'd like them to be?
These days, I think microservices, and keeping code as modular-alized as possible to avoid,
you know, giant, sort of bloated behemoth code bases is really important so that people can move 
fast and deploy fast.
But what I would say is a critical part of the deployment option is, you know, when you look at 
deployment and integrating your code, testing is fundamental.
So I would strongly urge all of you to really, really pay attention to testing and do use test driven 
development, TDD, test driven development, as a development habit that
you inculcate in your life as developers and engineers, it'll stand you in very good stead.
I think that's the single most important part, you won't always do it, but you should try and do it as 
much as you can.
You need to think about whether you want to canary, there's a canary in a coal mine analogy.
So there's a process called canarying where you try to roll out new code and test whether it's going 
to blow things up or break things and you want to think about, you know, you need to think about 
how quickly you need to release or not.
How quickly you may need to roll back your code or not.

Summary & Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: 
•	Software architecture functions as a blueprint and represents the importance of a good 
architectural design. 
•	Structured design breaks down a software problem into well-organized smaller solution 
elements whereas behavioral models describe the behavior of the system without explaining 
how the system implements the behavior. 
•	Developing UML diagrams saves time and money by helping developers quickly get up to 
speed on a project, plan features in advance of coding, and navigate source code easily. 
Types of UML diagrams include state transition, interaction, and class diagrams.  
•	Objects contain data, and they also have behaviors that prescribe the actions the object can 
take, whereas classes are blueprints for objects.  
•	A service-oriented architecture (SOA) consists of loosely coupled services that interface 
with each other via a communication protocol over a network. Distributed systems run 
on multiple services on different machines, but they appear to the end-user as a single 
coherent system. 
•	An architectural pattern is a repeatable solution to an architectural problem. Types of 
architectural patterns include 2-tier, 3-tier, event-driven, peer-to-peer, and microservices. 
Two or more patterns can be combined in a single system, but some are mutually exclusive.  
•	Application environments include development, testing or QA, staging, and production. 
Production environments tend to be more complex than pre-production because they must 
take into account non-functional requirements like load, security, reliability, and scalability.  
•	Application environments can be deployed either on-premises on traditional hardware, or on 
public, private, or hybrid cloud platforms. 
•	Common components needed for a production environment include a firewall, a load 
balancer, web and application servers, proxy servers, and database servers. 

About Software Engineers
What Does a Software Engineer Do?
Welcome to What Does a Software 
Engineer Do?
After watching this video, you will be able to Describe the types of software that software engineers 
develop and the technologies that they use
Identify the categories of software engineers and the teams they work in, and
Describe the day-to-day tasks and responsibilities of a software engineer
Software engineers use their talents in engineering, mathematics, and computing to design and 
develop software that solves real-world problems for their users.
If you're an analytical thinker who enjoys problem solving, software engineering might
be the career for you!
Software engineers develop a plethora of different types of software, from desktop and web 
applications, to mobile apps, games, operating systems, and network controllers.
They use many technologies to do this, including programming languages, development 
environments, frameworks and libraries, databases, and servers.
There are two categories of software engineer:
Back-end engineers, also known as systems developers, who build the computer systems
and networks that front-end applications use.
And front-end engineers, or application developers, who are more client focused.
They create the software that users will interact with, such as Android, iOS, and Windows 
applications,
and platform agnostic websites.
Software engineers work in a wide variety of settings.
You could work in a team developing:
Off-the-shelf software,
Bespoke software to meet a specific client's requirements, or
Internal software for users in your organization
And within your team, you might work on:
Data integration layers which access and load data from a variety of sources into your solution,
Business logic which applies real-world business rules to the data in your solution, or
User interfaces which enable users to interact with your solution.
As well as building your own systems, you'll also be testing, improving, and maintaining
software built by your colleagues.
On a day-to-day basis you might undertake tasks such as:
Taking user specifications and designing new software systems to meet their requirements
Writing code and testing that it works as expected
Evaluating and testing new software programs
Optimizing software programs for maximum efficiency
Maintaining and updating existing software systems
Documenting code so that other developers can understand it
Presenting new systems to users and customers
And some software engineers, such as DevOps practitioners, also integrate and deploy their
code onto the underlying infrastructure. As well as building your own systems
you'll also be testing, improving, and maintaining software built by your colleagues.
The responsibilities of a software engineer are as many and varied as the tasks which
they undertake.
In a junior position you are likely to start out with a limited set of responsibilities
focused on writing, testing, deploying and documenting code, but as your career progresses
this will widen.
And, in a senior role, you will likely have primary responsibility for multiple areas
of the software solution including the planning and designing phases.

In this video you learned that:
Software engineers design and develop a range of software solutions
Back-end engineers build the computer systems and networks
And front-end engineers build the user interfaces
Software engineers undertake a range of tasks, from designing and writing new software to
maintaining and updating existing software
As your career develops, you will move from being responsible for one small section of
code to many areas of one or more products

A Day in the Life of a Software 
Engineer
Hi, I'm Shelly and I work as a Software Engineer for a start-up company in North Carolina.
When I arrive at work in the morning, I spend some time catching up on my messages
and checking my calendar for the day.
Before heading to my daily standup meeting,
I quickly check the status of my code merge request from yesterday.
Great, it's got positive feedback from others in the team and some suggestions
from my mentor about improvements I could make. I'll work on those later.
During our daily standup meeting, each member of the team
talks about what they achieved yesterday and what they're working on today.
Jonathan, my mentor, gives me some more advice
about how I can optimize the code I wrote yesterday.
After the meeting, I return to my desk excited to implement
the feedback I've received and continue working on my code.
Now it's focus time, when I can concentrate purely on my project work.
I use Jonathan's comments on the merge request alongside the notes that I made
during our standup to re-engineer a couple of methods to run faster.
I also use some of our analysis software to compare timings with the previous version
and, when I'm satisfied that there's a marked improvement,
I submit a new merge request to gather additional feedback.
I then send Jonathan a message to ask if he can review it later today.
After lunch, I'm invited to a meeting where the marketing department
explains that they need a new feature to monitor the effectiveness of their campaigns.
One of the senior software engineers, Marie, mentions that she's previously developed a
React-based front-end for a management dashboard that we could easily reuse.
I'm tasked with creating a minimum viable product
(MVP) for a small team in the marketing department to trial and provide feedback on.
I've not used React before, but this is a great chance to get some hands-on experience with it
while still making a contribution to the team.
Learning on the job and developing new skills is an important part of a Software Engineer's role.
On my return from the meeting, I find that Jonathan has reviewed my code and approved
the merge request. He's impressed with the speed of the code and with my coding style.
It's really helpful to get regular feedback from more experienced members of the team
who can suggest alternative ways of solving problems.
I've also received a bug report notification for one of the features I was working on last week.
When I review the full report, I quickly spot the mistake and begin fixing it.
To check that the fix and the original functionality work as expected,
I develop and run a test case for the feature.
It passes, so I submit a merge request for my fix and resolve the bug.
Now I'm free to start researching React. I spend the rest of the afternoon reviewing
the React documentation, watching videos, and reading blogs to give me an overview of React.
I then contact Marie to ask for access to the front-end she developed so I can review the
existing solution. This gives me design ideas and inspires me to start planning my dashboard.
On my cycle home, my head is buzzing with thoughts about how the new dashboard
will look and the functionality I can provide through it. Tomorrow can't come quickly enough!

Skills Required for Software 
Engineering

Welcome to Skills Required for Software Engineering. After watching this video, you will be able 
to differentiate between hard and soft skills, describe the hard skills needed by a software engineer,
and describe the soft skills needed by a software engineer.
Hard skills are the practical skills needed to perform a particular role, so for a software
engineer these will be the technical skills they need to design, build, maintain, and
repair software solutions.
Hard skills are learned skills.
In the case of software engineering, they are usually learned in a school, college, or university 
environment, or by studying online courses, diplomas, or certificates.
Alternatively, they can be gained from years of experience in the field.
Hard skills are quantifiable, so it's easy to measure whether an individual can demonstrate a 
particular skill and to certify them in that skill. Commonly required hard skills in the software 
engineering sphere include programming languages,
version control, cloud computing, testing and debugging, monitoring, troubleshooting, Agile 
development, and database architecture.
Soft skills on the other hand are less tangible.
They are your personal characteristics and interpersonal skills.
They're the non-technical skills that are part of your personality and as such, are harder to define, 
quantify, or certify than hard skills.
Because they're not linked to a particular business though, they are easily transferable between 
roles and across industries.
The job requirements for any role will be a combination of hard skills and soft skills.
So, let's look at some of the hard skills that are relevant to a software engineer.
Software analysis and design skills are essential for a software engineer.
You need to be able to analyse your users' needs through a variety of methods and then
design effective solutions that meet those needs.
You also need to be able to develop those solutions.
Computer programming and coding are essential development skills.
While some job roles require a specific language and/or toolset, employers will sometimes welcome
you with experience in any language but expect you to cross-train into their preferred language.
The coding bootcamp website, Coding Dojo, states that some of the most in-demand languages
are currently Java, Python, C#, and Ruby.
An understanding of a variety of frameworks and object-oriented principles are also key
skills for a software engineer.
While you'd hope to always create flawless solutions, it is likely that at times your
code will either not work or not work in the way that you intended.
You need testing skills to determine whether your code meets the functional specification
of the solution and if it's easy to use.
And when your code isn't working as expected, you need debugging skills to work out why.
When your solution is complete, you need deployment skills to distribute it to your users.
These could include
shell scripting,
containers,
and continuous integration and continuous delivery (or CI/CD) tools.
You'll also need monitoring skills so that you can review the performance of your solutions
and troubleshooting skills to resolve any issues that may occur.
So now let's look at the soft skills of a software engineer.
Teamwork is a key soft skill.
Software engineers work in a variety of teams, some based on the project they're working
on and some based on their specific role.
If you're practising Agile development, you may also work in small teams known as
squads.
And you might also work closely alongside another developer in pair programming.
Working in teams enables you to take advantage of each individual's strengths as well as
providing opportunities for you to gain new knowledge and skills.
You'll need to be able to communicate with a wide range of stakeholders in your project
- from technical colleagues to non-technical personnel.
For example, you may need to ask:
your peers for support and ideas,
your manager for guidance and direction,
your client for clarification of their needs,
and your users how they'd best interact with your solution.
Software solutions are often time-sensitive projects and as such, your managers will be
keen that you meet their deadlines.
Managing your own time is imperative to ensure that you don't cause delays to others waiting
for your work.
And with increasing numbers of teams working across time-zones, what could previously only
seem like a small local delay can create a whole day of lost time for someone located
elsewhere in the world.
Software engineers need great problem-solving skills to succeed.
You need them:
in the design phase to work out how to create an appropriate software solution,
in the development phase to work out the code required to perform the task required,
in the testing and debugging phase to locate and resolve any bugs,
and throughout the lifecycle of the software to manage any
issues that may arise.
And when those issues do arise, you need to be adaptable to meet the changing needs of
the project.
Examples of changes include:
Your client requesting a change or addition to the functionality,
Your manager requesting you to move onto a different area to meet a looming deadline,
Or your user requesting an alternative method of achieving a specific task.
And finally, you need to be open to feedback on your work.
Most software teams use some type of peer review system where peers review each other's
code.
This helps enforce any corporate standards and improves the code.
In a junior role, you're also likely to have a mentor who'll provide feedback and
pointers where you can improve.
And your stakeholders will provide feedback on pre-release and final versions of your
solution.
Accepting all of this feedback in an open and welcoming way ensures that your solution
becomes the best that it can be and that you progress in your role.
In this video, you learned that:
a combination of hard and soft skills are essential to a software engineer.
Hard skills are measurable, learned skills such as:
Programming, testing, and troubleshooting,
And, soft skills are your personality and characteristics, such as communication and problem 
solving.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Advice to Future 
Software Engineers
Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Advice to Future Software Engineers.
In this video, we will hear from software engineers discussing their advice to those
who are considering getting into the field.
Practice, you should practice all the time, you should learn new skills as much as you
can.
There are a lot of free resources out there that you can use to help you build new projects,
I think the best way to continue working on your craft is to learn not only learn new
things, but also use them to build new projects.
It can doesn't matter if it's something that's been done before the point is that you're
doing it now.
And you're using the tools that you've used to build something new.
The most important thing for my career has been finding a business domain that I am interested
in, that has what that have looked like, not low hanging fruits, but interesting problems
to grapple with.
The interesting problems for you are certainly going to be the different than the interesting
problems for me.
But if you narrow down those, if you narrow down the domains that you're interested in,
that can really help tailor both of the things that you study the types of jobs that you
apply for.
I have other friends where their domain, the domains that they're super interested in is
like, like, machine learning, like they're just nuts for machine learning.
And so they'll do anything that they can exercise, like, an artificial intelligence kind of thrust
to the whatever business problem it is that they're working on.
So like find that general domain, and then kind of like, dive in on that one.
But don't be don't be scared to fail either.
I think the beauty about what's one of the one of the beauties about software engineering
and, and the way that tech is evolving, is there's there are a lot of opportunities and
it will continue to be new opportunities.
And you know, there's lots of movement in the industry.
So if you take a job and you really are excited about it, but you know, it ends up not working
out as well.
You can always think, you know, move to somewhere else.
There's lots of different types of lots of roles, lots of companies, all that sort of
people move around so don't don't don't let a one potential failure either mean, you give
up, I think it's wouldn't be a failure.

Yes, so my best advice for those looking to get into the software engineering industry
is to figure out what role you want to get into, make a list of the required skills for
that role and find free resources to start learning online.
So when I was exposed to coding in 2018, after trying a few technologies, I decided that
I wanted to be a front end engineer or a front end developer.
And so I made a list of all the skills that I needed.
And I started learning those skills using like free or low cost resources online.

I think being careful about what sort of hot and new there's, there's often this is more
specifically to like taking I think taking jobs and and how do you find like a good role and fit for 
you?
I know a lot of companies will often sort of market themselves as being you know, we're,
we're we're working with XYZ new technology.
It's, it's super, super hot.
And it's like the latest and greatest and almost use use buzzwords as a way to attract
people.
So just, you know, be inquisitive and ask clarifying questions.
Be wary in that sense.
You are cautious when it comes to some of the buzzwords and new things and just know
what you're getting into.

Don't neglect the job hunt process. Pay due attention to that.
Because if you just study and don't pay attention to the job hunt process, you're going to get
frustrated because you're going to finish one phase, and then have a long period of
frustration and self doubt after that.
So if you can do the job hunt phase in preparation, sort of in parallel with the latter half of
your learning journey, I think you're going to be prepared to hit the market hard when you're ready.
And it's just a question of time after that time.
Insiders' Viewpoint: Women in 
Software Engineering
Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Advice 
to Women in Software Engineering.

In this video, we will hear from software engineers discussing their advice to women
in the field or who are considering getting into the field.
I think recently, there have been a lot of good positive momentum, and diversification
of the industry and making, making software engineering a more welcoming place for women
in general.

So, I come from work environments that are you know, primarily women.
And now I'm in a work environment that is primarily men.
I think I've had a pretty good experience with my co-workers personally.
But in the beginning, it did very much feel like a little bit kind of like you're alone because you 
know, you're either the only or one of two or three women on your team.
I would say just remind yourself that you actually do deserve to be there that you actually do 
belong.
You do belong there, and everybody started exactly where you are.
Everybody who started as an engineer and even at your company started and was like I do
not know what's going on.
But you're capable and you'll figure it out.

If you're a software developer at a company, your main job should be software development.
And if your bosses or management or other people in the company want you to do other
types of work, you should be getting compensated for it, you should have a title that reflects
what it is that you do.
And I have seen this happen a lot where the woman on the team will be the one who cares
about diversity, for instance.
And so as part of diversity workshops and clubs at the at the company and is participating
in diverse hiring events and doing all sorts of like extra training around that side, that side of things, 
then review time happens.
And as a software developer, if you're getting reviewed on code, you need to make sure that
you're getting enough of that code in your life.
Everyone needs to contribute.
Everyone needs to pull their weight; it can't all go on one person.

Join a team that does make you feel like they do support women and want to elevate women
and advocate for women.
So I think it's very fair to ask directly to say, a hiring manager, you know, what, what is your plan 
for diversity on your team?
What types of programs do you or the organization or company have in place to, to ensure that
woman are successful, and you know, be willing and open to speak up if there's something
that you think is uncomfortable.
It's not all on you to fix if something is broken, there are other people involved.
And they also are adults who should be reasonable human beings, and able to take advice and
constructive feedback.
So let them take that advice and constructive feedback.
You don't have to do all the changing.
never be compelled to join a team where you're not feeling good about it, or you think that
there's a risk that it's not a welcoming, so ask other people to I think it's very fair to just ask those 
questions.

Don't stay, don't stay, if you don't like it, the company needs you more than you need them almost 
certainly.
So, leave when you can, if something isn't working out for you leave, you have that ability.
And there are companies that have less of that in their culture and less of that in their engineering 
teams.
It can feel rough trying to find it sometimes.
But if you do find yourself at a place that is not a healthy, positive, growing environment for you 
leave, it doesn't reflect on you, again, it reflects on the company.
And I know, any company, or organization that's even remotely taking diversity and inclusion
seriously, simply with regards to women, will have programs in place to support women, elevate
women.
And, you know, basically, there's an eye on that, and there as there should be, there's
a lot of effort being put into hiring women and getting women into senior leadership roles,
which I think is very important.

Figure out what role you want and find free resources to get into those roles.
One thing to bear in mind is as a woman, you know, we are a minority, and we are under-
represented in the tech industry.
So, there are a lot of free or low-cost programs tailored specifically to women who want to
get into computing or who women who are in computing looking to advance their careers.

Careers in Software Engineering
Job Outlook for Software Engineers
Welcome to Job Outlook for Software 
Engineers.
After watching this video, you will be able to
explain why demand is high for software engineers,
describe the job outlook for a software engineer,
describe what to expect from a software engineering role
and describe the employment options in software engineering.
There are various reasons behind the current high demand for software engineers.
Almost all industries need software to compete and grow.
This results in a continuous demand for software engineers.
Most organizations require applications and websites for their company to function.
Some apps and websites are for internal use, while others are used to interact with customers.
The Internet of Things is also driving the need for software that interacts with products.
This is a need that will continue to expand for the foreseeable future.
All types of software programs, from messaging applications to commerce websites to office
software, are available in different flavors from different vendors.
Whenever one vendor releases a new version of their particular program, a competing company
is likely to also update their program,
requiring more software engineers to create the new releases, enhance functionality, and
add new capabilities.
So, the outlook is bright for software engineers.
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a higher than average 22% job growth rate
for software developers, analysts, and testers from 2020 to 2030.
That's an average of almost 200,000 openings each year - in the United States alone!
These roles are likely to be across many industries, from mobile application development to health
and insurance.
There is also predicted to be a large increase in security software due to the increase in
computer security threats and cyber-crime.
Many software engineers are graduates with degrees in software engineering or computer
science.
However, increasingly employers like IBM, Google, and Tesla are starting to hire non-graduates
who demonstrate the required skills for the role.
This opens software engineering up to a wider range of society ensuring that the cost of
obtaining a degree doesn't preclude candidates from the industry.
Salaries for software engineers vary significantly with years of experience in the field.
As you acquire more experience and become harder to replace, employers typically provide
higher compensation.
In the USA, salaries range from $90,000 for a junior role through to $120,000 or higher
for an experienced position.
The average of $110,000 per annum for a software engineer is more than 2.5 times the average
base salary across the USA.
This, alongside bonuses and benefits such as medical insurance, gym membership, profit
shares, and retirement plans make a software engineering role an attractive proposition.
So, what should you expect from a software engineering role?
Dress codes are unlikely to be formal unless you're in a customer facing situation.
Hours are often flexible, sometimes around core hours set in the middle of the day.
You may occasionally be required to attend meetings or calls which can dictate a physical
or online presence at a particular time of day.
The number of hours are likely to increase as you get near to product release dates,
often without any matching increase in pay.
The flexibility to work from home varies across employers, but there are no technological
reasons why this cannot be done.
In fact, some software teams are spread across the globe, working across all hours of the
day.
Software engineer employers include almost any type of business that you can imagine.
From large technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google (also 
known
as FAANG),
to medium-sized software companies that develop specific software and solutions, to small
software houses and start-ups.
And almost all large non-technology companies like banks, retailers, and pharmaceuticals
need software engineers for their own internal or external systems.
And most employers will encourage continual learning, whether that be expanding your technical
skills or enhancing your soft skills.
They're usually keen to invest in you keeping your skills up to date so that you can develop
the best software solutions for them.
In the software engineering world, regardless of your job title, there are different employment
options to suit your lifestyle and situation.
Employed roles in a company or organization provide stability and a regular income.
These can range from an apprenticeship or internship, to a part-time role, through to
a full-time role.
In software engineering, more so than a typical job, there is a huge independent contracting
market and opportunities in the gig economy.
These can range from simple website development to super-specialized skills, languages, stacks,
and products.
In this type of employment, you can provide contract or consultancy services to organizations
on a time-based or project-based model
or you can work on a freelance basis taking on short-term contracts to work on projects
that interest you.
Many software engineers also code for free as volunteers contributing to open source
projects.
This can help you gain experience, enhance your skills, improve your employment opportunities,
and enhance your technical eminence.
It also makes you feel good by doing something for a cause or community or social initiative
that's important to you.

In this video, you learned that:
the high demand for software engineers is due to increasing needs for software, increasing 
complexity of applications, and a continuing growth of technology the outlook for software 
engineers is promising the role of a software engineer can be flexible and satisfying and you also 
learned that employment options for software engineers are flexible and varied, from full-time 
employment through to voluntary act .

Career Paths in Software Engineering
Welcome to Career Paths in Software Engineering.
After watching this video, you will be able to describe typical career paths for a software engineer,
and identify the likely roles within career paths.
A career path in software engineering opens up as you gain experience and attain new skills.
Often it heads in one of two directions: technical or management.
If you thrive on working with code and solving problems, then the technical path enables
you to continue working closely with technology as your career progresses.
Or, if you exhibit strong leadership qualities alongside the soft skills of a good software
engineer, you might progress onto managing a team of software engineers and the work
that they do.
So, let's take a look at a common career path for a software engineer progressing on
the technical or managerial path.
Remember that different organizations will use different job titles, but the roles will
be similar across the board.
You're likely to start out in an entry-level position as a Junior Software Engineer or
Associate Software Engineer.
At this level you'll be developing small chunks of software to meet agreed client specifications.
You'll be assigned a team leader or mentor who will guide you along the way and provide
support when you need it.
During this phase of your career, you'll be on a steep learning curve, gaining new
skills and experience with every block of code that you write.
You could then move on to a Software Engineer position.
In this role you'll be expected to be more independent and able to able to break larger
tasks down into smaller achievable sub-tasks.
You may be learning new programming languages and demonstrating an understanding of the
software development lifecycle.
At this stage, you might be asked to mentor a junior software engineer or take responsibility
for a larger part of a project.
The next stage of your career could be a Senior Software Engineer position.
In this role you're likely to have involvement across the whole of a project and with an
entire codebase.
You may be asked to mentor software engineers and to conduct code reviews across the team.
And from the experience you've gained in earlier roles, you'll be expected to be
able to solve a wide range of problems in an efficient way.
If you choose to follow the technical path, then your next role might be as a Staff Software
Engineer.
In this role you'll work as part of the technical team developing, maintaining, and
extending software.
You'll be responsible for ensuring that the software meets customer and user expectations
and that it uses resources efficiently.
If you decide to follow a managerial career path, you could become a Technical Lead.
In this role you'll manage the team of developers and engineers developing the software in your
organization.
You could be responsible for the entire development lifecycle and report to the project stakeholders.
Continuing along the technical path, you might progress to be a Principal Engineer or Technical
Architect.
At this stage you'll be responsible for the architecture and design of a software
solution, as well as the development of it.
You'll be expected to create processes and procedures for your team and provide technical
direction.
On the managerial path, you could become an Engineering Manager.
In this role, you'll ensure that the entire team is appropriately supported and encouraged
to progress in their careers.
Becoming a Director of Engineering could be the next stage in the progression of your
career.
It is a strategic and technical role.
On the strategic side, you'll determine priorities for the projects within the company,
identify hiring needs, and define long term goals.
On the technical side of the role, you'll be involved in defining new projects, specifying
requirements, and overseeing the project.
The lead of an organization's technology arm is likely to be the Chief Technology Officer
(or CTO).
In this role, you oversee all of the research and development in the company.
You'll also monitor the company's systems and infrastructure to ensure that it meets
your needs and budget.
Even at this level, you'll continue learning.
As technology evolves and new products appear on the market, you'll be responsible for
deciding which ones meet your business needs and could give your organization a competitive
advantage.
Of course, not everyone who starts out as a Junior Software Engineer follows these traditional
software engineering paths, but you'll find that the skills you gain will benefit you
in a wide variety of other roles.
If after working on client projects for a while you decide that you prefer interacting
with the clients to writing the code, you could transition into a technical sales or
customer support role.
If you enjoy coding, but find working with numbers and data is more appealing, you could
transition into a data engineer or data scientist role.
And, if you find the data side of your new role is your passion, you could move on to
become a database administrator or database developer.
And if you enjoy finding and fixing bugs, you might transition to a software tester
role.
IT is a vast field with an abundance of opportunities across many skill sets, so starting your career
in software engineering is a great choice even if you use it as a stepping stone to
move to other technical or leadership roles in the future.
In this video, you learned that:
A career in software engineering is likely to follow a technical or managerial path.
At each stage on that path, you will take on more responsibility and a wider range of
tasks.
And, starting out as a software engineer enables you to take an array of other options at any
stage in your career.

Insiders' Viewpoint: Career Paths

Welcome to Insiders' Viewpoints: Career Pathways and Continuing Education in Software
Engineering.
In this video, we will hear from experts discussing how they became software engineers, their
education, and their background.
So I have a non traditional path into software engineering, my bachelor's degree is in social
work.
And I worked as a social worker for some time, I was introduced to coding
via social media, randomly on social media, I was scrolling in December 2018.
And afterwards, I kind of fell down the rabbit hole of learning how to program and I decided
to go to a 10 month long, very intense coding boot camp to make the switch into software
engineering.
And so one thing I have learned over the past three, three and a half years, is that your
career doesn't have to be linear, and your career doesn't have to look like anyone else's
I just picked computer science, I love math.
That's the only thing that I think really drew me to computer science was oh, it's if
you love math, apparently, you will love computer science too.
So I think some of the most successful engineers that I, that worked for me, or I've worked
with, come from backgrounds, not even sort of, like mine, neither people with like, with
non-technical backgrounds, who picked up coding on the side,
there's so many folks who come from, from you know, they are English majors or philosophy
majors or bio, whatever it is.
Because I think there's this you can you can learn all these skills and become a really
strong engineer, without having gone to a four year college or, or more for computer
science, specifically, or, or another engineering role.
And so in college, I ended up taking what was it, applied math, I did applied math as
my major.
I want to I always wanted to work on things that had a practical application, which is
why I went into applied mathematics rather than pure mathematics anyway.
Yeah, so I did that research program.
And as part of that program, we were writing simulations, using MATLAB actually.
That was a fun time.
So we were writing simulations using MATLAB, and I realized I enjoyed that part more than
I enjoyed the mathematical research part of it.
And that's kind of what kicked it all off.
Like, oh, computers are a lot of fun.
So I ended up graduating college with an Applied Math major, Computer Science minor.
And then I've been taking computer science jobs ever since then.
So I received a Bachelor of Fine Art of actually.
So not anything tech related.
And I worked in education for a few years, I ended up as an art teacher.
And it was during that time that I decided that I wanted to switch paths because I wanted
a little bit more freedom.
With my job more flexible schedule, I wanted the opportunity to work remotely.
So I decided to take a class to see if I would like it at a community college near my house.
And I really, really loved that class.
And at the same time, kind of just watch videos on Udemy and YouTube and teach myself some
things that I wasn't learning in class.
I took 32 credits at the community college level.
And then after that, I did apply to graduate school.
While in grad school, I received an internship offer at my current company and did a summer
internship and directly following that I started full time.
Next, we will hear from these experts regarding how they maintain their skills and keep up
with the continuous technology evolution.
I follow people on Twitter who talk about emerging technologies and new technologies.
I also subscribe to this newsletter called TLDR.
And they pretty much just surmise everything that's going on in the tech industry. That's what I like 
to do to keep up to date.
I also take various courses on things that are interesting to me.
Yeah, I think just just carving out time to learn, whether it's within your often companies
will give people some amount of time to for personal development and growth which can
be which can mean taking courses to learn new languages or frameworks.
I've found that I learned best if I have a project that makes me need to learn the thing.
So I started with Googling, like, honestly, Reddit threads, frequently are the best places
to find out about like, what are the popular and new technologies these days.
If you just search on Google for like, the best website framework, Reddit 2022, you'll
find numerous posts of people debating the pros and cons of different types of frameworks.
And then actually, another very important thing is debug it.
Attach a debugger put in print statements.
Do everything you can to be able to inspect the flow of the code that is getting that
is getting run.
Knowing how to debug is about almost equally an important skill as knowing how to write
the code.
But the way that I kind of keep on top of everything is reading documentation.
I have really great coworkers who are always also in the know of like, when things are
updated when languages are updated when to use new new technologies.
So they helped me out a lot there.
And we also get Udemy for free, like Udemy business for free for all employees, which
is a really great way to learn new things and also stay on top of new technologies that
that come out.

Code of Ethics

Welcome to Software Engineering Code of Ethics. After watching this video, you will be able to:
State each of the eight principles in the Software Engineering Code of Ethics.
And, explain each of the eight principles in the Software Engineering Code of Ethics.

The Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices developed
a Code of Ethics outlining their goals and standards for software engineers engaged in the design 
and creation of software.
The task force was formed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Computer 
Society or IEEE-CS and the Association for Computing Machinery or ACM in order to 
recognize the prominence of computing in global commerce, government, and society.
This IEEE-CS ACM joint task force championed the need to hold software engineers accountable
so that the present and future status of the field as a beneficial and respected profession is 
maintained.
The Code of Ethics consists of eight principles that pertain to the specification analysis, design, 
development, testing, and maintenance of software, and are dedicated to serving the public 
interest.
These principles are intended for anyone who is in or related to the profession, and includes
engineers, mentors, instructors, managers, students, and policymakers.
Here, we will summarize each principle. However, the full text of each principle and its additional 
clarifying clauses can be found on the IEEE-CS and ACM websites.
The principles in the software engineering code of ethics focus on the following topics:
Public
Client or employer
Product
Judgement
Management
Profession
Colleagues
Self.
The public principle comes first because it is expected that software engineers should
act primarily in accordance to positively affect the public good.
This includes accepting responsibility for their work with regard to safety, fairness, accessibility, 
and integrity.
Next, software engineers should act in the best interests of both the clients and their
employers.
They should act honestly and be forthright when it comes to unethical actions such as
plagiarism or illegal activities.
They should seek consent where necessary and appropriate and honour confidentiality.
The third principle relates to the product under production.
Software engineers should seek quality while keeping in mind cost and timelines.
This next principle outlines how software engineers act with integrity and independence
in their professional judgment.
They are expected to maintain objectivity and honesty when working with the software
and relevant documents they are involved with.
Software engineers should not engage in any inappropriate financial activities such as bribery and 
double billing, nor may they accept duties that create a conflict of interest.
Software engineering managers and leaders should also behave in a manner consistent with these 
principles where it applies to them and those they manage.
They should work to minimize risk and employ security procedures.
Managers and leaders should also work to ensure realistic expectations of their staff, provide just 
compensation, and procure intellectual property rights whenever appropriate.
The profession is principle describes the duty of software engineers to protect the reputation 
of the profession by acting with integrity and not elevating themselves at the expense of 
others.
Software engineers should let managers, employers, and clients know they intend to
act in compliance with this code of ethics and express concern over violations of the code.
Similar to the profession principle, software engineers shall treat their colleagues with respect and 
fairness.
They should encourage their peers to comply with this code of ethics and not take credit for the 
work of others.
The final principle, focused on the software engineer themselves reminds software engineers
about the importance of lifelong learning and professional development.
They should endeavour to create quality software and strive to conduct themselves in a professional 
manner.
It should be noted that this code of ethics is not a replacement for conscientious decision-making
and common sense, but it can be used as a supplemental guide.
Knowing when and where to apply these principles will always be up to the discretion and wisdom
of the individual.

In this video, you learned that:
The code of ethics serves the public interest to hold software engineers accountable in the analysis, 
design, development, testing, and maintenance of software The eight principles in the code of ethics 
are
Public
Client or /employer
Product
Judgement
Management
Profession
Colleagues and Self.

Scrum Master Role and Benefits

Hello and welcome to this module on what is the role of the scrum master and the benefits of the 
role.
After watching this video, you'll be able to define the scrum master role, summarize the scrum 
framework and the scrum masters involvement, and explain how the scrum master role benefits the 
organization.
A scrum master is not a project manager.
In contrast, they act as coaches, facilitators and team members.
Unlike project managers, a scrum master does not plan the overall project from start to finish.
Manage budgets, control risks or procure material.
Nevertheless, some of their tasks are associated with those performed by project managers.
scrum masters lead teams, remove roadblocks, participate in the planning process for the team's 
work.
Lead meetings and scrum events, improve processes, reports to the management, support product 
owner and other stakeholders and help the team work together.
As a coach, a scrum master removes impediments and to promote a healthy team environment.
As a facilitator, they lead the scrum process, plan activities, track and collect data, and to help bring 
work to completion.
Traditional project managers execute a predetermined plan to produce deliverables.
While scrum masters utilize an iterative and incremental approach to complete work.
A scrum master must navigate through the complexities of aligning and realigning the team to the 
vision of the product owner and ensure the team provides value as planned.
Let's look at the steps in the scrum process.
During sprint planning part one-step, the team selects requirements or user stories from the product 
backlog they believe they can accomplish during the sprint.
The scrum master schedules this event and ensures everyone on the team participates.
In addition, the scrum master ensures that the team commits to what they can achieve in the plan 
timeline.
Scrum master works closely with the product owner to ensure the user stories selected are
well-defined in the terms of the role, need, value and acceptance criteria.
The product owner is responsible for the development and upkeep of the product backlog.
However, the quality of the user stories in the product backlog directly impacts the scrum master 
and the team.
In Sprint planning part 2 the team must complete a sprint backlog.
This is a breakout of all requirements into tasks.
The scrum master again ensures that the entire team participates.
They also facilitate, ensuring the team self organizes and assigns roles to each task.
During the sprint, the scrum master facilitates a daily scrum meeting.
They ensure everyone participates in the meeting.
They also ascertain that the sprint Kanban board is updated and then any burndown charts
being used are current.
If there are blockers, the scrum master acts to have them removed.
If there's a conflict, the scrum master manages it.
The goal of the sprint is to develop a minimal viable product MVP by the end of the sprint that
satisfies user story done criteria.
In the review or demo step, the scrum master ensures that all accomplished work during the sprint is 
ready for presentation on the sprint's final day.
They work closely with the team to present functionality and attain feedback.
In many cases, the scrum master prepares the product owner to present the functionality at the 
meeting.
The scrum master facilitates a retrospective at the end of the sprint.
At this meeting, every member of the team shares what went well, what can be improved and
their ideas for one big improvement.
The scrum master ensures that there is consensus on the improvement items selected and
works towards adopting it in the newsprint.
According to the scrum alliance, a scrum master provides immeasurable value to an 
organization.
Scrum masters ensure that the team is doing the right thing.
Scrum masters inspire the team and others to follow the scrum process and adhere to the 
scrum values without wavering.
Scrum masters or coaches and teachers.
They are servant leaders who put others before themselves.
They ascertain that the team has the skills and tools needed to succeed.
The scrum master ensures that the entire organization understands the value of scrum and
ensures the team's work is recognized.
The scrum master proactively identifies and addresses blockers and impediments and
paves the way for the team success.
Let's discuss other benefits of the scrum master role.
Scrum masters constantly search for improved ways to serve the team and organization.
They ensure retrospectives are accomplished and all team members must participate and most 
importantly, positive changes are implemented.
A solid scrum master is also known as a waste buster.
Scrum masters work with other scrum masters in the organization and share their expertise and 
insights.
In doing so, they gain additional knowledge and insights that help them improve their effectiveness.
Scrum masters are master problem-solvers, who help the organization achieve value-driven 
solutions.
In addition, they are always one step ahead of the rest of the team and planning for a better 
tomorrow.

In this video, you learned that unlike project managers, a scrum master does not plan the overall 
project from start to finish, manage budgets, control risks or procure material.
Scrum masters lead teams, remove roadblocks, participate in the planning process for the team's 
work and help the team work together.
The various steps in the sprint process are Sprint planning 1 and 2, sprint, review or demo and 
retrospective.
Scrum masters have various benefits.
They are coaches and servant leaders who lead by example.

Expert Viewpoints: What does the Scrum 
Master Do?

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints.
In this video, we will hear Agile and
Scrum experts describe the role of the Scrum Master.
Its unique functions and  to its success.
In my opinion, the role of the Scrum Master is the facilitator and
the servant leader.
Your job is to ensure that the team understands and is following the Scrum principles, practices and 
values.
The way I like to think about it is the product owner focuses on building the right thing.
The development team focuses on building the thing right, and the Scrum Master focuses on 
building the thing efficiently.
So what are the aspects of the Scrum Master role that are most critical to success?
I believe that the aspects of the Scrum Master role that are most critical to the success of a Scrum 
Master is that of being a servant leader, being a coach and being a mentor.
These are crucial in your ability to help the team understand and follow Scrum.

My opinion, the overall role of a Scrum Master is to facilitate
the effective implementation of his Scrum principles and practices.
Promote collaboration, remove impediments, and foster continuous improvement.
Unlike other roles, the Scrum Master does not have authority over the team, but serves as a servant 
leader and facilitator.
A Scrum Master has a unique role in many ways.
A Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the team and organization understand Scrum theory 
and practice.
In a sense, they need to sell the value of Scrum.
So, they are not solely accountable for the team's effectiveness alone, but they are accountable to 
the entire organization as a whole.
A Scrum Master must epitomize servant leadership to be effective.
This service takes the form of, number one, coaching the team.
Number two, the Scrum Master guides the team and positions them to create high value increments.
Number three, one of the key roles of the Scrum Master is to remove impediments or blockers.
And finally, a Scrum Master is a master organizer and facilitator.
A Scrum Master differs from most other management roles.
A Scrum Master is not necessarily responsible for doing the work, but they are tasked to pave the 
way for the team to accomplish its goals.
Rather, they prepare the team to self-organize, determine what needs to be done, and work 
together to accomplish what is referred to in Scrum as done.

Being a Scrum Master is multifaceted.
It's not one dimensional at all.
You are a coach, a leader, a guide, an expert in the Scrum framework process.
Your goal is the team's success.
That's why you're there.
Notice that I didn't say anything about completing tasks, project management.
That's because this is what makes the Scrum Master a little
bit different from other roles.
You're not even a manager in the hierarchical sense.
In fact, you're trying to put yourself as far behind the scenes as you can.
You are a servant leader, you are the person that is there to support the team and however you can 
make that successful, that's your job.
You need to help them get to the finish line.

The main role of the Scrum Master is to facilitate the Scrum processes and ceremonies.
And to act as a coach to the team through their adoption of the Scrum framework.
Unlike the product owner, they are not involved with the product strategy, the why of the product.
Nor are they like the development team in determining how the work is done.
They are the conduit between the two and fostering that communication is one of their 
responsibilities that is most critical to success.

First and foremost, understand the Scrum process and ensure it is understood and followed.
A Scrum Master is in a sense a process manager.
Next, the Scrum Master is also a facilitator and a coach.
They must facilitate all required events and ensure the right people are present and contribute.
As a coach, ensure the team is empowered to self direct and excel on the job.
The Scrum Master is also a conflict manager.
If a conflict surfaces, the Scrum Master collaborates with all involved to reach a satisfactory 
resolution.
In addition, the Scrum Master engages stakeholders to recognize and leverage different ways of 
thinking.
And ensures all stakeholders are working together to achieve the goals of the project.
And finally, the Scrum Master is a status manager.
They ensure the Kanban board is up to date, develop and maintain burn down charts.
Collaborate with the product manager to ensure the backlog of requirements is current and refined 
as needed.

A Scrum Master is a servant leader, a facilitator, a coach, a good communicator, a liaison, a good 
observer.
The most important role, the most vital aspect of a Scrum Master is removing impediments and also 
being that binding agent, that agent that binds the entire team together.
That way, the team is able to meet its prints goal and at the end of the day, the customer is going to 
be satisfied with all the work that has been done during the sprint.

You're focused on the team's success.
It's not really about your success.
You're not successful if the team is not successful.
It's not just about finishing tasks or success is defined by the customers needs.
And you're there to help the team get there because there's going to be challenges, there's going to 
be roadblocks.
And you're going to be the one to help them clear a path to the success that is defined by your 
customer or your product owner.
And you're going to help them get better along the way.
You're going to do process improvement and you're going to show them how they can be 
successful.


Scrum Master Skill Inventory


Welcome to this module on the skills necessary to be a successful Scrum Master.
After watching this video, you'll be able to, summarize skills necessary to be a successful Scrum 
Master, and explain the need for each skill.
There are a number of key skills a Scrum Master must learn and become proficient at to be 
effective.
Much of the information shared is extracted from a document called the Scrum Guide.
This document provides a blueprint to effectively implement Scrum and was originally created and
updated by some of the founders of the original Scrum methodology.
First and foremost, the Scrum Master must be an expert in the Scrum framework.
This person must possess a thorough understanding of Scrum methodology.
The team in the organization expect the Scrum Master to know how to guide the organization.
In some cases, you may be expected to lead an organization through a transformation from 
traditional project management methodology to Scrum.
A Scrum Master must have the skills necessary to be an effective servant leader.
To be effective, the following servant leadership skills are essential, manage relationships, 
encourage and create development opportunities, build effective communications with the team and 
across the organization.
Effective communication builds trust and credibility and increases the team's motivation to commit 
to doing the work that needs to be done, encourage the team to embrace success and provide 
development opportunities to grow, facilitate collaboration and act as a diversion shield.
Support everyone to be creative and innovative, encourage the team's participation, understanding, 
and creativity, and create a sense of shared responsibility.
A team can generally accomplish far more together than a single individual.
In addition, shield the team from external distractions as much as possible so they can concentrate 
on the work at hand, remove organizational impediments and obstacles, look for issues, blockers 
existing processes, and out-of-date practices that limit the team's effectiveness and pave the way to 
process improvements and improve performance.
The Scrum Master facilitates end of sprint retrospectives and can help achieve this goal.
Educate all stakeholders on both the value of Scrum and how effective implementation can provide 
value.
The Scrum Master must act as a change agent to move the organization forward.
As a Scrum Master, develop your coaching skills.
A Scrum Master is expected to coach team members to become self-directing, self-organizing, and 
skilled in cross-functional communication.
A key goal is to enable any and all team members to assume the role of a Scrum Master.
Help the Scrum team focus on creating high-value increments that meet the definition of 
Done.
An increment is a deliverable from a sprint that provides value to a customer.
Done indicates that the team was able to accomplish all solution criteria for a user story and 
gain sign off from the customer.
General management skills are also needed to ensure that the team stays focused and doesn't deviate 
from what needs to be done.
The goal of each sprint is to create and deliver a Minimum Viable Product, or MVP.
A Scrum Master needs to understand the purpose and desired outcomes of all scrum events and 
ceremonies.
They must ensure all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the 
timebox.
These include sprint planning, the daily stand-up meeting, demos, and retrospectives.
A Scrum Master also needs to be an effective process manager.
A Scrum Master must be able to identify and address sources of conflict.
This includes promoting functional conflict that may move the sprint forward, or mitigating 
dysfunctional conflict which can get quickly out of hand and impact a sprint negatively.
Scrum Masters must be skilled negotiators and problem-solvers.
Without these skills, it is impossible to help the team achieve success.
This may involve negotiation with stockholders, the product owner, other managers, and anyone 
who influences the team's success.
They should know how to create opportunities to collaborate and how to facilitate a team to stay on 
track.
For example, a Scrum Master may need to bring in a different Scrum team to collaborate if there is 
an intersection between the work that these teams are doing.
If the only way to get increments to meet the definition of Done is through collaboration and 
problem-solving, the Scrum Master must facilitate that process.
Scrum Masters need to be effective in facilitating the estimation process and ensuring expert input 
is received as needed from the right sources.
The Scrum Master assists in ensuring that the team understands its velocity.
Velocity is defined as a measure of how much work a team can successfully accomplish in a sprint.
Do not overpromise and underdeliver.
The Scrum Master needs to understand the role of the Product Owner and assist this individual to be 
successful.
This includes assisting the Product Owner in product goal definition and product backlog 
development and management, ensuring all stakeholders understand and agree with all the user 
stories in the backlog, and facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.
The Product Owner has distinct responsibilities.
However, a good Scrum Master ensures the success of the Product Owner.
The product owner is responsible for developing user stories, creating and managing the 
product backlog, prioritizing user stories, and working with the team to determine which 
stories can be accomplished in a given sprint.
The Product Owner also needs to refine the backlog to ensure user stories in the queue are 
ready to implement in the next sprint.
The quality of the backlog directly impacts the Scrum Master and the team.
The Scrum Master assists in the refinement process.
In Scrum, decisions are made on an observation and experimentation rather than a detailed upfront 
planning.
Empirical process control is a concept that must be understood and embraced by a Scrum 
Master.
It relies on the three main ideas of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
Transparency, transparency allows all facets from any Scrum process to be observed by anyone.
There are no secrets in Scrum.
This provides an easy and transparent flow of information through the organization and creates an 
open work culture.
A Scrum Master must be transparent.
Inspection, the Scrum Master needs to ensure that the information is shared with all key 
stakeholders.
This includes access to user stories and the product backlog, accessibility to information radiators 
such as the kanban board and sprint burndown chart, and invitations to product demos and reviews.
Adaptation, adaptation is the ability to learn and improve through transparency and information 
sharing noted in the first two ideas of transparency and inspection.
In this video, you learned that a Scrum Master may not have all of the answers.
However, they do lead the way to find them.
This requires knowing how to set realistic goals and achieve them, understanding the capabilities of 
your team, and knowing how to drill down when clarity is needed.
Arguably, the most important skill a Scrum Master must pursue is to become an effective 
communicator.
Strong communication skills impact every key skill we define in this skill set inventory.

Expert Viewpoints: Scrum Master Skills

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints: Scrum Master skills.
In this video, we will hear Agile and Scrum experts discuss Scrum Master skills, share tips for new 
Scrum Masters and describe a Scrum Masters typical day.
A few skills required to be a Scrum Master include understanding Agile principles in the Scrum 
framework, facilitation skills and metrics and reporting skills.
Part of your role will include assessing the health of the sprint and that will most likely include 
common metrics like velocity, cycle time, and burn down charts.
To a new Scrum Master looking to improve their skills, I would suggest seeking me abundance of 
training there is out there, whether it'd be free training and webinars or articles, and take little 
nuggets from each of these and continuously improve.
Describe a typical day as a Scrum Master.
A Scrum Master's typical day is spent facilitating the daily scrum and other scrum ceremonies 
depending on where you're at in the sprint, problem-solving and removing impediments, coating the 
team, and supporting the product owner.
You should have at least some experience managing projects of some sort.
Now, that's a very broad range of potential projects that you could manage.
But there should be some experience of coordinating things.
Remember, none of these people who report directly to you.
You are coordinating people over whom you really don't have any real authority.
Your authority is by your example, by the support that you bring to the team.
You should have some understanding of the industry that you're working in, the product.
A lot of times people crossover to Scrum from being an expert in another area and it's just a natural 
development.
For example, if you have a system that you're building, you could naturally crossover and offer that 
expertise as a Scrum Master and it will also help you because the team will know that you have that 
expertise in your background.
You don't need to be an expert, but you should be good at removing roadblocks.
Get to know the organization.
A lot of the work of the Scrum Master is not so much a technical skill as much as people skills and 
getting to the point where you can help the group.
You want to get to know the players involved, you want to get to know the appetite for Scrum in the 
organization.
A lot of times this is a new thing for an organization to adopt.
You want to be able to help them be successful and spend time understanding what it means to be a 
coach and a servant leader.
If you miss those things, then you probably will not have as much success as you want as a Scrum 
Master.
Know the framework of the Scrum cold.
This is your job, You are the expert in the organization, and if people have questions about scrum,
you are the person that should be able to facilitate those answers.
Well, one of the great things about being a Scrum Master is that it's never the same.
Your day may be completely different from the last and very different from the next.
You may spend your day facilitating meetings.
During a sprint, you may do a daily standup, depending on where you're at in the development 
process, you may be facilitating a retrospective sprint review and working with the product owner,
working with the team, removing roadblocks.
So there's just no telling what your day could bring, it really just depends on how the project goes.
There may be days where you find that the team is not performing at a very high level and your job 
is going to be to figure out why, and how to help them to get back on track.
Maybe a team member needs assistance from you, you may spend your whole day working with 
that team member to clear that path so that they can complete their work.

To become a Scrum Master, one needs a combination of technical and soft skills.
Technical skills include a deep understanding of a gentle methodologies, a Scrum framework,
and relevant tools such as JIRA, Confluence. Soft skills include strong communication,
facilitation, coaching, problem-solving, conflict resolution, leadership, and the ability to trust
and foster collaboration within the team.
To improve as a new Scrum Master, continuously learn and stay updated on a gel practices,
seek mentorship or coaching from experienced Scrum Masters, actively participate in Agile 
communities and forums, reflect on your experiences, seek feedback, and iterate on your approach.
Embrace a growth mindset and be open to learning from both successes and failures.
A typical day as a Scrum Master involves facilitating daily stand-up meetings, coaching the team on 
a giant practices, helping deemed to remove impediments, assisting product owner in backlog 
refinement, conducting retrospectives, collaborating with the stakeholders, and ensuring the teams 
adherence for Scrum principles and goals.

One thing is to make sure you have a thorough understanding of the Scrum pillars and values as 
coaching the team is a big part of your job.
You'll need excellent communication and facilitation skills, get to know Agile management tools 
like JIRA. Every day you'll be facilitating Scrum ceremonies.
I'm working with a team and the product owner on the work being delivered during the sprint.
To develop your skills, consider shadowing other Scrum Masters in your organization or take a 
certification class or join a community of practice .

A Day in the Life of a Scrum Master

Welcome to this module on a day in the life of a Scrum Master.
After watching this video, you'll be able to summarize critical tasks a Scrum Master must perform 
on a daily basis and to find challenges the Scrum Master may encounter and how to overcome them.
A Scrum Master has various responsibilities.
While each day brings new challenges, there are standard tasks a Scrum Master must accomplish in 
a day.
Let us review some of these key duties.
The Scrum Master facilitates the daily stand up meeting.
This is often referred to as a daily scrum meeting as well.
This is normally done first thing in the morning.
The three questions asked are what each team member did yesterday, what they will do today, and 
are there any blockers or impediments?
The Scrum Master must ensure that every team member participates in response to the three 
questions.
During the meeting, the Scrum Master tries to ensure that all team members have worked to 
perform.
In addition, the Scrum Master must take action in a variety of areas based on the result of this 
meeting.
During the stand-up meeting, the Scrum Master encouraged as each team member to update
their portion of the Kanban board, all burn down charts must be maintained for the sprint and are 
updated at the conclusion of the meeting as well to show progress and determine how the team is 
progressing.
If the sprint has issues, the Scrum Master works to resolve them.
If there are conflicts or issues, the Scrum Master immediately ensures the impact of team members 
work together to resolve them.
The Scrum Master tries to encourage the team to self-correct and resolve all conflicts internally
to the greatest extent possible.
If the Scrum Master support is needed, they get involved.
It is important to note that conflicts are not resolved during the daily stand up meeting.
The Scrum Master than addresses any blockers.
The goal is to resolve the blockers as quickly as possible.
This may entail working closely with the product donor or other key stakeholders in the 
organization.
The Scrum Master also act as a coach whenever possible, the Scrum Master shares information, 
guidance, and provide support to any and all members of the team.
The Scrum Master is a servant leader.
They put the needs of others ahead of self.
Every Scrum Master takes pride in preparing junior team members to both understand and assume 
the role in the future.
The Scrum Master is also a master event planner.
They make the team ready for any ceremonies planned in the near term.
Along with the daily stand-up key ceremonies including sprint planning, demos, and retrospectives.
The Scrum Master may need to spend time assisting the product owner to refine the product 
backlog and ensure it is ready for the next iteration or sprint.
A best practice is to have all user stories for the next two sprints ready for implementation.
The scrum master has a number of challenges to overcome.
A Scrum Master has critical responsibilities and often minimal authority to accomplish them.
A Scrum Master needs to establish themselves as a subject matter expert within the organization,
along with the trust and credibility with the team.
They have to wield influence on the team without much authority.
A sprint is time-bound.
Unlike a traditional project, the length of the sprint is set and cannot be extended.
They must work closely with the team to ensure all tasks are completed on time.
There may be times when the team is virtual.
This makes coordination and time management even more difficult.
Keeping senior management happy can be a real challenge.
Many managers are used to traditional project management methods and do not understand Scrum.
This can lead to potential interference and push back.
A Scrum Master needs to be capable of sharing the scrum process with the management
in a way that emphasizes the benefits and leads to acceptance by them.
Many stakeholders do not understand the role of a Scrum Master.
They assume a Scrum Master has the same job description roles as their traditional project manager,
education than patients are needed at times to be successful.
Finally, there may be times when stakeholders want to change direction in mid sprint.
When this occurs, the Scrum Master needs to be flexible, acknowledged the change, and update
the product backlog in conjunction with the product owner.
While at the same time doing all day cannot to disrupt the currents sprint and stay the course is 
planned.

In this video, you learned that scrum masters roles are very diverse.
Ensure that team stays organized, focused, and on track to satisfy the goals of the sprint, acts as a 
bridge between management and the team ensuring the team has not distracted from its primary 
tasks, ensures impediments and blockers are identified early and do all they can to and motivate 
them to perform at the highest levels.




Adaptive Methodologies
By the end of this Reading, you will be able to define various adaptive methodologies where the 
Scrum Master role is essential.
Scrum Masters serve in a number of adaptive methodologies to include Scrum. In some 
methodologies, a Scrum Master may be referred to as a Team Facilitator.
In a 2022 "State of Agile" report, Scrum or a hybrid of Scrum is used by 81% of all Agile or 
adaptive practitioners. However, there are other adaptive methods worth being aware of.
•	Extreme Programming (XP): XP is a software development methodology intended to 
improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. XP 
advocates frequent releases in short development cycles intended to improve productivity 
and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.
•	Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe): Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) is a set of organization 
and workflow patterns intended to guide enterprises in scaling Lean and Agile practices. 
SAFe is one of a growing number of frameworks that seek to address the problems 
encountered when scaling beyond a single team.
•	Kanban: Kanban is a methodology that uses many Scrum methods. Requirements are 
placed on a Kanban board and flow across the board from start to finish until completed. 
Each requirement begins in the Backlog or "To Do" column. When work begins, the 
requirement moves to "In-Progress." When the requirement is completed, it moves 
across the board to "Peer Review," "In Test," and ultimately, "Done." If a requirement 
is blocked, it is placed on the Kanban board accordingly until the blocker is resolved. A key 
feature of Kanban is "Work in Progress" limitations. There can only be so many 
requirements in each category on the Kanban board. This ensures that work is evenly 
distributed and that the team has adequate capacity to complete each requirement during 
each column or phase.
•	Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM): An Agile project delivery framework

Module 1 Summary: The Role of the Scrum 
Master
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 
•	Unlike project managers, a Scrum Master does not plan the overall project from start to 
finish, manage budgets, control risks, or procure material.
•	Scrum Masters lead teams, remove roadblocks, participate in the planning process for the 
team's work, and help the team work together.
•	The various steps in the Sprint process are Sprint Planning I and II, Sprint, Review or Demo, 
and Retrospective.
•	Scrum Masters are coaches and Servant Leaders who lead by example.
•	A Scrum Master knows how to set realistic goals and achieve them, understands the 
capabilities of the team, and knows how to drill down when clarity is needed.
•	The most important skill a Scrum Master must pursue is to become an effective 
communicator.
•	Scrum Masters ensure the team stays organized, focused, and on-track to satisfy the goals of 
the Sprint.
•	Scrum Masters act as a bridge between management and the team, ensuring the team is not 
distracted from its primary tasks.
•	Scrum Masters ensure impediments and blockers are identified early and do all they can to 
resolve them.
•	Scrum Masters support the teams and motivate them to perform at the highest levels.
•	Scrum Masters serve in a number of adaptive methodologies to include Scrum like Extreme 
Programming (XP), Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), Kanban, Dynamic Systems 
Development Method (DSDM), Crystal, and Lean Software Development.

Module 2 Overview and Key Takeaways
Welcome to Module 2 of the Introduction to the Scrum Master Profession course.  In this module, 
we begin with a comparison and contrast of typical project management roles and responsibilities as 
compared to those in Scrum.  As a Scrum Master, many of the traditional skills and competencies 
you have as a project manager translate well into Scrum.  In other cases, there are new skills you 
need to develop.
Next, our Subject Matter Experts (SME) share their thoughts on whether or not someone who does 
not have a project management background can become an effective Scrum Master.  You will hear 
their opinions of traditional project management skill sets similar and different in nature to those of 
Scrum.
Our SME video is followed by an overview of various skill set levels needed to transition to a 
Scrum Master role.  You will also gain insight into the benefits of becoming a Scrum Master as 
compared to those of becoming a traditional project manager.
Scrum Master employment opportunities in the current environment, along with some specific job 
postings will be shared and analyzed.  We'll discuss where the jobs are! We will also share the 
various levels of the Scrum Master role and how to climb the Scrum Master career ladder 
successfully.  

Scrum Master and Traditional Project 
Manager Comparison 


Welcome to this module on comparison between scrum master and a traditional project manager.
After watching this video, you'll be able to compare scrum master and traditional project manager 
roles and contrast scrum master and traditional project manager roles.

A project manager and scrum master have roles that in many cases require the same set of skills.
However, the focus and definitions differ greatly.
A project manager is accountable for defining requirements, building a scope, creating a Work 
Breakdown Structure or WBS, and gaining approval of the scope baseline.
They manage predictive projects.
A scrum master confirms requirements with the team that are shared in the form of a user story by a 
product owner.
The product owner is responsible for generating the initial user story.
The scrum master enables a sprint backlog, which breaks out each user story into assignable tasks 
produced by the team.
They support adaptive products.


Project managers build a comprehensive schedule that must be approved by the sponsor and 
accepted by stakeholders.
A scrum master, however, helps manage a sprint.
This is a timebox iteration to produce a minimum viable product or MVP, in a time-boxed 15 or 30 
day iteration or period.
Scrum masters also help the team apply relative estimation techniques to classify user stories 
by complexity in the form of story points.
The higher the story points, the more complex and involved in the user story is.


Project managers must build a project budget.
A scrum master may assist the product owner with budgeting matters.
The product owner is responsible for the budget.


Both project managers and scrum masters ensure quality is built into a product.
The project manager develops a quality management plan.
The scrum master ensures that the team understands the definition of done and works to achieve it.
Project managers identify and procure resources.


They also assign roles and responsibilities.
A scrum master ensures that the team self-organizes and identifies who will perform what tasks in 
the sprint backlog.


Project managers control communication through a comprehensive communication management 
plan.
A scrum master ensures open communication through the use of Kanban boards, burndown charts, 
and other documents available to anyone on the team.


Project managers develop a comprehensive risk management plan and stakeholder register to 
manage risk.
A scrum master helps the team assess user story risks to determine the complexity of the work.
The scrum master needs to be capable of performing roles that differ from traditional project 
management roles.
Let's share a few examples.


Project definition is critical.
A project manager leads the effort to develop a project charter and project management plan
that provides a roadmap for the project.
This plan is provided to the team and drives execution.
The plan defined specific team roles and responsibilities that the project manager ensures are 
accomplished.
A scrum master on the other hand, provides direction to the team to determine what the project will 
deliver.
The scrum master helps the team define the project deliverables through the validation of
user stories developed by a product owner.
They do not dictate the plan.
Rather, they act as a coach and facilitator to ensure that the team self organizes and develops the 
plan in the form of a sprint backlog.


The project manager is the voice of the customer.
They work closely with customers and key stakeholders to determine the executed product or 
service state.
The project manager leads the team's efforts to develop the project scope, schedule, and cost 
baselines.
The scrum master works with a product owner who determines the requirements.
The scrum master is focused on ensuring the team understands the requirements and is
able to get the work committed to done.
A scrum master will ensure that the selected user stories are accomplished within the timeframe of 
the sprint.
Launch planning is normally accomplished by the product owner.


Both the project manager and scrum master perform issue management functions.
The project manager solicit status, identifies issues, and ensures that they are addressed in a timely 
manner.
The scrum master identifies issues or blockers on a daily basis, normally through the facilitation of
daily stand-up or scrum meetings, and ensures that they are addressed as quickly as possible.


Both the project manager and scrum master needs to be skilled in facilitation.
A project manager must facilitate status reviews, change meetings, pre-baseline and
baseline presentations, and more.
A scrum master needs to facilitate and ensure that the team participates in sprint planning,
the sprint, demos, and retrospectives.
These are classified as ceremonies and scrum.


A final contrast regard to the perception of the role. Project managers are normally
recognized as essential to the success of the business.
Sponsors provide authority to plan and execute the product.
A scrum master role may not be understood or recognized as critical.
A scrum master often needs to be capable of influencing the team without authority
to perform their required tasks.

In this video, you learned that project managers and scrum masters are similar in
the way that they define requirements, manage schedule, budget, ensure quality, manage roles and 
responsibilities, communication, and risks.
determination of scope, issue management, facilitation, and role perception

Expert Viewpoints: Traditional Project 
Management and the Scrum Master

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints.
Scrum Master opportunities.
In this video, we will hear agile and Scrum experts describe how someone who does not have a 
Project Management background can become an effective Scrum Master.
And compare the role of a Scrum Master to the role of a traditional Project Manager.
>> No, you don't have to have a traditional project management background to be a Scrum Master, 
and in some ways that could be better.
As Project Managers and Scrum Masters are distinct roles, there are similar soft skills used like 
communication and organization.
But Project Managers are about process control, managing work, scope, and cost.
Whereas a Scrum Master is an enabler role, more of a coach and facilitator, removing impediments, 
working with the team and product owner on the delivery of the sprint.
>> Yes, of course, someone without a project management experience can become an effective 
Scrum Master.
I have seen technical and functional team members evolving into Scrum Master roles.
While project management experience can be helpful, but it's not the must.
The key qualities of a Scrum Master such as facilitation, collaboration, coaching, and leadership can 
be developed and improved through training and practice.
The Scrum Master and traditional Project Manager roles have similarities such as focusing on 
successful project delivery and working with stakeholders.
In addition, they both require communication and problem-solving skills.
However, they differ in authority, approach, team empowerment, and focus.
A Project Manager role has more formal authority, follows a structured approach, may have a more 
directive role, and focus on managing constraints.
A Scrum Master serves as a servant leader, embraces an iterative approach, empowers, self-
organizing teams, and focuses on removing impediments and facilitating collaboration within the 
Agile framework.
>> While it will help that you have had project management experience, it certainly doesn't 
preclude anybody from becoming a Scrum Master.
Being a Scrum Master is more than just technical skills.
It takes the right type of person who has the right type of attitude and goals and interests in working 
with people to make them a successful Scrum Master.
If you are the type of person that would rather elevate the team and let the team take the credit and 
not look for your own glory, then this is really where you fit in.
Scrum Masters are servants, they're servant leaders.
And so if your motive is to get the spotlight or be the hero or anything like that, then really being a 
Scrum Master may not work out so well for you.
Your one job is to get the team to success.
Now that doesn't mean that you won't get credit for the work you've done, of course, you will.
But if you're motivated by helping others, then that's the type of person that succeeds as a Scrum 
Master.
Scrum Masters are just not there to help the team complete tasks.
The Scrum Master's focus is the success of the team and that may mean getting the team to work 
well together.
Teaching them how to work well together, reminding them of the goals, reminding them
of why they are there, supporting them, getting them to think about different ways of doing things, 
all for the goal of success.
Now, the Scrum Master facilitates the process and the process that they're facilitating is the Scrum 
framework.
That is a really key component, what makes it different than a traditional Project Manager.
Now, there's some similarities, of course, you want to help the team to get their work done, that's 
kind of the point.
But where the difference really lies is people over process.
And that is straight out of the Agile Manifesto, which is really the foundation of Scrum.
>> Yes, someone with no project management background can still become an effective Scrum 
Master.
Though it is easier for someone with project management background to become a Scrum Master 
because most of the work that they need to do is detach themselves from the traditional mindset and 
be in the Agile mindset.
Now, if you have no project management knowledge, you can still be an effective Scrum Master.
All you need to do is go down to the basis of learning the software development lifecycle, put in the 
work and you can still do very great.
A traditional Project Manager is usually involved from the initiation process, budgeting, 
implementation, and all that.
While as a Scrum Master, you are typically involved in the development part of it.
So as a Scrum Master you're making sure that an MVP, which is a most viable product, is being 
constantly delivered. So that's the main difference.
Developing Scrum Master Skills

Hello and welcome to this module on how to develop Scrum Master skills.
After watching this video, you'll be able to, define desired levels of project management knowledge
and expertise required to transition to the Scrum Master role, and summarize the benefits of 
becoming a Scrum Master compared to a traditional project management role.
A Scrum Master requires a certain amount of prior project management knowledge to improve their 
chances of success.
Some Scrum Master skills can be acquired with past project management experience.
However, project management skills, knowledge and expertise give a Scrum Master a decided 
advantage.
A Scrum Master needs to be an effective coach, facilitator, issues manager, and a servant leader,
you do not have to have project management experience to develop these skills.
However, time spent as a project manager makes it easier to attain these skills.
A Scrum Master needs to be a great organizer, understand the business environment and effectively 
interface with customers.
The product owner is the voice of the customer and elicits customer requirements.
The product owner is responsible for developing and managing the product backlog.
Customers share their available budget and desired time-frames for the launch.
The Scrum Master, however, often interfaces with customers to remove blockers and share 
information.
They must also foster good communication and teamwork within the team.
These skills can also be developed without being a project manager.
However, as stated earlier, time spent as a project manager allows you to develop these skills.
There are some project management skills, however, that a Scrum Master should possess to be 
successful.
Key project management skills such as requirements development, project planning, and 
scheduling, resource management, and risk management are essential to success.
Project scope management skills are required to facilitate the development of a sprint backlog.
The development team develops the sprint backlog, the Scrum Master ensures
Projects schedule management skills are necessary to manage the sprint and ensure all tasks are 
planned and completed on time.
Project quality management skills are necessary to ensure inspection and adaptation needs are met.
Project resource management skills allow the Scrum Master to ensure everyone is contributing
to achieve the overall goal of done.
Project communication skills are essential to ensure transparent and effective 
communications.
Scrum advocates osmotic communications.
The term was coined by Alistair Cock-burn, one of the signers of the Agile manifesto.
''Osmotic communication means the information flows into the background hearing of the 
team members so that they pick up relevant information as through by osmosis."
The Scrum Master ensures that the environment is conducive to osmotic communications.
Project risk management skills are necessary to ensure risk is factored into user story point 
estimates.
As a review, a story point is a measure of the complexity of a user story that determines
the amount of time and effort needed to complete it.
A user story with a story points up eight will take more effort and is more complex than a user story
scored at five story points.
In addition, a Scrum Master will likely need to work with project managers as many projects are 
hybrids that both use Scrum and traditional project management methods.
In such cases, some preliminary project management training and experience will allow
the Scrum Master to be effective in that role.
The traditional project manager role is rewarding and beneficial in many ways.
You are able to turn great ideas into reality and help move the organization forward.
However, more and more traditional project managers are transitioning into adaptive or Scrum 
related positions, such as product owner and Scrum Master.
Let's understand what the benefits are of becoming a Scrum Master.
The project management environment is becoming more complex.
The need for new innovative products delivered quickly to an increasing demanding market is 
growing.
There is a significant shift in project management to leveraging adaptive or agile life cycles.
Scrum remains the most widely used adaptive methodology.
This equates to a significant and growing demand for experienced Scrum Masters.
According to a number of studies, the need for Scrum Master is increasing,
demand for Scrum Masters will continue to grow, which itself leads to job security.
Here's a quote from braintrust.com. With Agile becoming more popular across a wide variety of 
industries, the need for Certified Scrum Master is only increasing.
On average, Scrum Masters earn more than non-qualified counterparts, with the experienced Scrum 
Master earning around $100,000 per year in the US.
Financial rewards are high.
A recent study by scrum.org in 2022, surveys Scrum Masters and calculated the average Scrum 
Master salary at approximately $84,000 annually.
As you gain experience, average salary increases.
The field is growing and the salary is very competitive.
Most people agree that salary and job opportunities are important, however, being a Scrum Master
is not all about the money.
The Scrum Master role can be highly rewarding in many other ways.
Scrum Masters assume a servant leader role and help other people achieve success, this is hugely 
rewarding in and of itself.
They also help organizations adapt to changing business conditions and flourish.
Scrum Masters with success stories behind them will remain much in demand for many years to 
come.

In this video, you learned that a Scrum Master needs to be an effective coach, facilitator, issues 
manager, and leader.
Project management skills, knowledge, and expertise give a Scrum Master I decided advantage.
Key project management skills such as requirements development, project planning and 
scheduling, resource management, project communication, and risk management are essential 
to success.
Demand for Scrum Masters will continue to grow, which lends itself to job security.
The Scrum Master role is rewarding as it helps people and organizations achieve success.

Scrum Master Employment Opportunities

Welcome to Scrum Master Employment Opportunities.
After watching this video, you'll be able to describe opportunities for Scrum Masters in the current 
work environment.
Identify websites to explore potential Scrum Master employment opportunities.
The need for Scrum Masters is on the rise.
Scrum originated to improve the delivery of software products.
However, Scrum is more and more prevalent in non-information technology industries.
Let's review a few industries where being a Scrum Master may open opportunities for you.
Automotive, the automotive industry has changed dramatically over the years.
Traditional slow-moving assembly line technology has been replaced with the need for rapid 
innovation and adoption of sophisticated electronic systems essential to the vehicle's success.
Two prime examples of automotive companies that have embraced Scrum are Tesla and Toyota.
Education, more and more universities are adopting a Scrum methodology to bring diverse 
departments together to be more efficient and organized.
Development of course, curriculum, and new educational programs effectively use a Scrum 
approach.
In particular, many universities prescribe Scrum as a method for research and development projects 
supporting their doctoral programs.
Construction, construction projects have become more complex over the years.
Technological complexity has increased and agreements on the final project has decreased.
Scrum has become a common methodology to help multiple leading construction companies plan, 
design and execute products.
shifting to Scrum methods to innovate, produce quick prototypes, and beat the competition in the 
market.
Examples include aeronematic companies like Boeing and Airbus, technology leaders like IBM and 
Siemens, and wireless providers like T Mobile and AT and T.
Social Media, social media companies like Meta and Twitter use Scrum to upgrade their platforms,
enhance security, and improve customer experience.
Finance, the finance industry faces continuing needs to develop new systems to satisfy the complex 
needs of their customer bases.
Companies such as bank of America, RBC, Royal Bank, and more are turning to Scrum to develop 
innovative solutions in a way that keeps them one step ahead of the competition.
These are just a few examples of companies embracing Scrum and opportunities that they offer.
Chances are good that a product or service that you depend on was a deliverable from a Scrum 
team.
There are several sites to access for employment as a Scrum Master.
Some top sites include Indeed and Glassdoor, Monster, ZipRecruiter, Career Builder, and iHire.

are automotive, education, construction, product development, social media, and finance.
A few of the top job sites for employment as Scrum Master include Indeed and Glassdoor, Monster, 
ZipRecruiter, CareerBuilder, and iHire.
Scrum Master Levels
Welcome to this module on Scrum Master levels.
After watching this video, you'll be able to identify the Scrum Master position job requirements as 
regards to experience and skills, describe various salary ranges from entry-level to experienced 
Scrum Masters.
Scrum Masters have varying degrees of expertise and experience.
An entry-level Scrum Master position has less rigid expectations than a more experienced Scrum 
Master position.
The Scrum Alliance uses a three-step certification hierarchy to define these roles, responsibilities, 
and expectations of Scrum Master.
The Project Management Institute, or PMI, offers insight into Scrum Master levels
and skill requirements as well.
We will discuss four levels of Scrum Master experience and expertise.
Level 1, at this level, the Scrum Master has no experience or certifications.
This aspiring Scrum Master should possess some basic project management experience.
However, experience is not mandatory.
Level 2, at this level, the Scrum Master has no experience but has certified Scrum Master CSM 
certification.
CSM certification ensures that you have a basic understanding of the methodology used in Scrum.
You will understand various Scrum roles, essentials of Sprint Planning, keys to execute a successful 
sprint, demos, and retrospectives.
The training you'll receive qualifies you to apply for many entry-level positions and use the skills 
you learned to your advantage.
The Project Management Institute offers a Disciplined Agile Scrum Master Certification or DASM.
Requirements for certification are similar to that of the CSM.
There is a bit more emphasis on understanding Lean foundations and Disciplined Agile principles.
Level 3, at this level, the aspirant has one year of experience as a Scrum Master and five years of 
experience in project management related fields.
The Scrum Master has acquired Advanced Certified Scrum Master or ACSM certification.
As an ACSM, you are expected to understand and be able to apply all of the skills of a CSM.
In addition, you are expected to have coaching, facilitation, collaboration, and Scrum scaling skills 
beyond that of the CSM, the Project Management Institute offers a Disciplined Agile Senior Scrum 
Management certification, or DASSM.
Requirements for the certification are similar to that of the ACSM.
There is a bit more emphasis on understanding team-building techniques and emotional 
intelligence.
Level 4, this is the level where the candidate has at least two years experience as a Scrum Master 
and five years of experience in project management related fields.
They also have a Certified Scrum Professional, Scrum Master, or CSP-SM certification.
As a CSP-SM, you are expected to share experience with practical problems, solutions that go 
beyond the skills required to be successful at other levels.
This requires in-depth training, knowledge, and the skill level essential to excel at this level.
Some of the DASSM requirements discussed previously are included in the CSP-SM certification 
requirements as well.
A recent study conducted by higher ultron.com stated that Scrum Master salary fall within the 25 
highest paying jobs in America.
Salary ranges are based on the candidate's level of experience, location, company skills, and 
industry.
Scrum Master salaries are highly competitive on a worldwide basis.
An individual with no certification and minimal experience will average $69,000 annually.
This confirmates with our level 1 Scrum Master overview.
An entry-level Scrum Master is one with minimal experience but possesses a CSM certification.
On average, starting salaries average $84,000 annually.
This is consonant with our level to Scrum Master overview.
A level 3 Scrum Master can expect to earn approximately $100,000 annually.
Level 4 Scrum Masters earn a salary in the 117,000 annual range.
As you can see, salary will increase as you gain more experience and acquire multiple certifications.
The need for Scrum Masters is increasing and the compensation is excellent.

In this video, you learned four levels of Scrum Master experience and expertise are, level 1, at this 
level, the Scrum Master has no experience or certifications.
Level 2, no experience, but has certified Scrum Master or CSM certification.
Level 3, one year experience as a Scrum Master and five years experience in project management 
related fields, Advanced Certified Scrum Master, ACSM certification, and Disciplined Agile
Senior Scrum Master Certification or DASSM.
Level 4, two years experience as a Scrum Master and five years experience in project management 
related fields, and certified Scrum professional, Scrum Master or CSP-SM certification, including 
DASSM.
Level 1 will earn an average of $69,000 annually.
Level 2 will earn an average of $84,000 annually.
Level 3 will earn approximately $100,000 annually.
Level 4 earns a salary in the $117,000 annual range .

Expert Viewpoints: Why Become a Scrum 
Master

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints, why become a Scrum Master?
In this video, we will hear agile and Scrum experts discuss why someone with a project 
management background would want to become a Scrum Master or develop Scrum Master skills.
You'll also hear which traditional project management skills translate well into Scrum.
Someone with a traditional broad project management background might want to become a Scrum 
Master or develop a Scrum Master skills for several reasons.
The benefits include the opportunity to work in an agile environment which are becoming 
increasingly popular, enhanced ability to adapt to changing project requirements, improved 
collaboration and team dynamics, increased focus on delivering value to customers, and the 
potential for career growth and expanded job opportunities in Agile organizations.
The Scrum Master role offers the opportunity to learn new ways of working outside of a normal 
traditional waterfall approach and will allow you to grow your project management skills.
With Scrum, you will work in a collaborative, adaptable and value driven environment and 
approach to project management.
As a Scrum Master, an experienced project manager would be able to leverage their existing skills 
while embracing an Agile mindset and enjoying the benefits that come with Agile.
Communication and facilitation skills and traditional project management translate well into Scrum.
It really depends on what you want out of your career.
If you love coaching people, if you love making others better, and that you find that rewarding, 
those are the benefits alone.
If you enjoy helping your team build the best product or service possible, best program possible, 
then this is something you would definitely enjoy.
If you enjoy teaching, facilitating, the Scrum Master role would be great.
If you enjoy solving problems, you're going to get to do a lot of that.
And you work very independently in the sense that you do not have a structured day to day set of 
tasks that you clock in, do the work, clock out, go home, it is going to be whatever you need to do 
to support the team.
More and more organizations are transitioning to an Agile framework and developing Scrum Master 
skills will no doubt help your employability.
Also, I found using Scrum empirical processes like transparency, inspection and adaptation with my 
traditional projects greatly increased our chances of success.
You'll be able to transition a number of your soft skills like communication, organization and 
facilitation, along with risk management and working with stakeholders.
First, there is a significant shift in project management to leveraging what refer to as adaptive or 
agile life cycles, and Scrum remains the most widely used adaptive methodology.
This equates to a significant and growing demand for experienced Scrum Masters.
Next, according to a number of recent studies, the need for Scrum Masters is increasing.
Demand for Scrum Masters, according to projections, will continue to grow, which lends itself to 
some excellent job security.
Next, the financial rewards are high.
A recent study by scrum.org in 2022 surveyed Scrum Masters and calculated the average Scrum 
Master salary at approximately $84,000 annually.
As you gain experience, the good news is the average salary increases, Scrum Master can be a 
hugely rewarding role in many other ways.
Scrum Masters assume a role of a servant leader to help other people and the team achieve success.
This is typically hugely rewarding in and of itself.
They also help organizations adapt to changing business conditions and thrive.
Scrum Masters with a track record of doing this will remain in much high demand for many, many 
years to come.
Some traditional project management skills that translate well into Agile or Scrum, to be specific, 
include, but are not limited to planning, project composition, risk management, communication, 
technical competence, stakeholder analysis and engagement.
Again, these are just a few.
There are definitely lots more.
Several skills in traditional project management translate well into Scrum, including communication 
and stakeholder management, planning and organizing, risk management, problem solving and 
leadership.
However, Scrum also requires shift towards servant leadership, facilitation and fostering self-
organizing teams.
The ability to coordinate people really makes a big difference.
If you can motivate others, inspire others, make them believe in what you are doing, you will be 
successful.
And these are all things that you have to do as a project manager.
A lot of times nobody reports to you, so you're asking them to do more work than they are already 
doing for their job.
That happens in Scrum and in project management.
So if you're good at that, that skill really will lend itself to your success.
And most importantly, you really should be an expert communicator and you should be able to get 
the team to communicate with each other.
A lot of times you'll find that that is a struggle, that team members want to just go and do the work.
And you have to build that team environment because it is a team job to complete the project and 
there is no one person that stands out over above the other.
They all have their expertise in the area that you're working on.
But getting them to work as a cohesive unit is one thing that really makes Scrum different than 
project management.
The majority of similarities impact the soft skills area.

Both project managers and Scrum Masters need to develop solid facilitation techniques.
Both are required to plan and execute various meetings and events, or as it is referred to in Scrum, 
ceremonies.
Both need solid organizational skills.
A project manager needs to ensure all planning is accomplished to pave the way for a successful 
project.
Likewise, a Scrum Master ensures all planning is accomplished in an organized manner to pave the 
way for a successful sprint.
Effective communication is critical to both roles.
Both project managers and Scrum Masters are required to interact with numerous stakeholders on a 
daily basis to discuss a myriad of issues, eliminate blockers and ensure everyone is on the same 
page.
Last but not least, conflicts will occur in both a traditional and Scrum project.
Both roles need to effectively promote functional conflict and diffuse functional conflict.

Module 1 and 2 Review and Key Takeaways
The job of the Scrum Master is critical to the success of any organization using Scrum. Let's review 
some highlights and key takeaways from our "Introduction to the Scrum Master Profession" 
Course.
The Scrum Team
The Scrum Master works closely with a product owner and the development team. Key roles 
include:
•	Product Owner: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value resulting from 
the increments or work resulting from each Sprint. They act as the voice of the customer, 
develop product goals, develop initial User Stories, create and manage the Product Backlog, 
and ensure the backlog is transparent, visible, and understood.
•	Scrum Master: Scrum Masters are Servant Leaders. They serve the team and the larger 
organization. They ensure everyone understands the Scrum process, apply servant leadership 
principles by eliminating blockers, shield the team from external distractions, and act as a 
motivational force.
•	Development Team: Developers are committed to creating useable increments during each 
Sprint. They self-organize, complete the Sprint Backlog, adhere to the definition of "done," 
adapt efforts to achieve the sprint goal, and hold each other accountable as professionals.
Scrum Master Skills and Competencies
A Scrum Master requires a number of skills and competencies to be successful. Here is a brief 
review.
•	Coach the team to be self-managed and adept at cross-functional collaboration.
•	Facilitate key events or Scrum "ceremonies" to include Sprint Planning, the Daily Scrum 
Meeting, Sprint reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives. Ensure these events occur on time and 
maximize participation.
•	Serve the Product Owner and team by ensuring all User Stories in the Product Backlog are 
clear and concise, assist in backlog "refinement," and support stakeholder collaboration as 
required.
•	Lead, train, and coach the organization on Scrum adoption.
•	Understand and advocate "Empirical Process Control." By this, we mean promote 
transparency, ensure inspections occur as required, and work with the team to adapt to 
change.
The Scrum Process
The Scrum Master is also a process manager. They work closely with all stakeholders to ensure the 
Scrum process is understood and adhered to.
•	Sprint Planning-User Story Selection: User Stories are the primary means of identifying 
requirements. Initial User Stories submitted by the Product Owner identify each requirement 
by role, need, and value. The Scrum Master ensures acceptance criteria is well-defined and 
understood before User Stories are placed and prioritized in the Product Backlog. The Scrum 
Master facilitates a meeting with the team and Product Owner to select User Stories the team 
believes they can complete in a Sprint.
•	Sprint Planning -Sprint Backlog Development: The Scrum Master ensures the team self-
organizes and completes a Sprint Backlog. The Sprint Backlog breaks each User Story into 
tasks. The team self-manages and determines who will lead the completion of each task.
•	The Sprint: The Scrum Master coaches the team, manages conflict, and facilitates the Daily 
Scrum Meeting. They ensure the Kanban board is updated, Burndown Charts are accurate, 
support the team if blockers are present, and ensure everyone stays on track to accomplish 
Increments as "done."
•	The Review: The Scrum Master sets up the meeting, ensures the team is ready to present, 
coaches the Product Owner to lead the review, and gathers customer feedback on all 
increments produced. The Scrum Master assists the Product Owner in backlog refinement as 
necessary.
•	The Retrospective: The Scrum Master facilitates an end-of-Sprint Retrospective where the 
team shares what went well, what can improve, and votes to implement one positive change 
in the next Sprint.


Welcome to expert viewpoints, Scrum Master employment.
In this video, we will hear Agile and Scrum experts guide someone with traditional PM experience 
to become a Scrum Master and how best they can accomplish this goal.
They will also give advice to those aspiring to be Scrum Masters or someone who wants to get hired 
as a Scrum Master.
When I transitioned from traditional project management,
I was able to job shadow and experience Scrum Master and see firsthand how the role differed from 
what I was used to.
Other options if that's not available, take a certification class.
Also, join a community of practice if that will enable you to network with and learn from others in 
the industry.
This will also help if you're trying to get hired as a Scrum Master as they can help give you job 
leads.
My advice would be to learn and make sure you understand Agile and Scrum, and shift your 
thinking from a traditional plan-driven approach to an adaptive and collaborative mindset.
What advice would you give those aspiring to be a Scrum Master?
What I would suggest is to seek training and potentially certifications as a Scrum Master.
There are many trainings and certifications out there that allow you to truly gain an understanding 
of the role and will increase your chances of getting hired.
I'd say step 1 is figure out what really interests you and spend some time learning about Scrum.
Spend some time figuring out, if you prefer the more task oriented structure way of doing things on 
the project management side or do you really enjoy uncertainty and solving problems and figuring 
out how you can help the team?
Because that's what you would be doing as a Scrum Master.
It's hard to say on a day-to-day basis exactly what roadblocks you'd have to remove, what kind of 
issues you would have to solve.
It's really unknown but you have to be prepared for pretty much anything that comes your way.
As a Scrum Master, spend some time figuring out if coaching is something you're interested in or 
facilitating.
If you really enjoy that process development and understanding processes,
and holding those processes, make them structured and really help the organization use them.
Then Scrum is probably for you.
Well, in simple I mean you have to do your research.
Talk to some other Scrum Masters, find out what others in the industry are doing.
To transition from a traditional project manager to a Scrum Master, focus on gaining a deep 
understanding of Agile principles and a Scrum framework.
Seek training and certification, such as CSM, VSM. Learn Agile metrics, collaborate with 
experienced Scrum Masters and embrace the mindset shift towards servant leadership, facilitation, 
and fostering self organizing teams.
Gain practical experience by actively participating in Agile projects.
First and foremost, hone your traditional project management skill set.
These skills include facilitation, taking an organized approach to planning, being an effective 
communicator, understanding and being able to apply critical interpersonal skills such as decision-
making, problem-solving and coaching, and finally, managing conflict.
Secondly, learn as much as you can about your organization and the products and services they 
feature.
Learn as much as you can about Scrum processes and values.
Try to find a successful Scrum Master or perhaps maybe two who are willing to coach and mentor 
you.
Take time to attend some formal Scrum Master training and if possible, reward yourself with a 
Scrum certification.
Next, start out by attending a certified Scrum Master class and become an entry-level Scrum 
Master.
In the project management institute a comparable certification track to the Certified Scrum Master 
is the Disciplined Agile Scrum Master or DASM.
Next, set your sights on becoming an advanced certified Scrum Master.
You can reach this level normally after you have 1,
2, 3 years experience.
The Advanced Certified Scrum Master is expected to have higher skill sets and stakeholder 
engagement, a higher ability to manage change, to scale Scrum, and gain commitment of 
stakeholders.
In the project management institute, a comparable certification track is the Agile Certified 
Practitioner, otherwise known as PMI, ASCP certification.
Once you have more than five years experience, try to become a certified Scrum professional.
Some traditional project management skills that translate well into Agile or Scrum to be specific, 
include but are not limited to planning, project composition, risk management, communication, 
technical competence, stakeholder analysis, and engagement.
Again, these are just a few there are definitely lots more.
Learn about the work that you'll be doing.
I think it's critical that you understand what you're getting yourself into.
Being a Scrum Master in one industry may not be the same in a different industry.
It may look a little bit different just depending on the type of work that you're doing or the product 
that you're developing.
Network. Talk to folks who do this work.
See why they do it and what they get satisfaction out of being in these roles.
If you're inclined to do traditional project management, you'll find the focus on the team success as 
opposed to completing the project a little bit different.
See you complete the project and complete the tasks naturally.
That's always the goal of doing the work but your focus is a bit different.
Whereas your traditional project management, you have a timeline, you have a list of tasks that 
need to be completed.
In Scrum, you may not know what's coming up for the next sprint so you are always adjusting and 
shifting.
Helping the team be successful through those changes is really critical.
To become a Scrum Master or get hired for this role, focus on gaining a strong understanding of 
Agile principles and the Scrum framework.
Obtain a Scrum certifications, gain practical experience through internships or volunteer work.
Showcase your communication and facilitation of skills and demonstrate a passion for continuous 
learning and improvement.
One advice I would give to those aspiring to be Scrum Masters is to take your time and learn the 
software development life cycle.
In the past, it was easier to get away with just having your communication skills, facilitation in 
order.
These days, companies are looking for someone with technical competence.

The Path to Certification PMI-ACP, PMI-
DASM, and CSM  

Welcome to the path, the certification.
After watching this video, you'll be able to summarize the focus of each certification, defined 
testing and experience requirements.
Describe additional Agile, Scrum and project management related certifications impacted by this 
course.
This module will feature three certifications that apply to this course.
These three certifications are popular Agile or Scrum credentials that can help your career.
We will also provide an overview of additional project management certifications that you can 
achieve in this course.
Certified Scrum Master or CSM, is an entry-level Scrum certification administered through the 
Scrum Alliance.
CSM is one of the most popular and recognized Scrum certifications.
A CSM certification recognizes your solid understanding of Scrum and practical ways to apply it to 
your team and organization.

However, a passing score is generally about 80%.
Test costs are included with your training costs.
DASM is now available in Spanish and Portuguese.
The PMI ACP certification recognizes an individual's expertise and using Agile practices and their 
projects while demonstrating their increased professional versatility through Agile tools and

In this video, you learned Certified Scrum Master or CSM, is an entry-level Scrum certification 
administered through the Scrum Alliance. DASM is an entry-level Scrum certification administered 
through the Project Management Institute or PMI. The DASM exam is administered through 
Pearson VUE.
The PMI ASCP certification recognizes individuals expertise and using Agile practices in their 
projects while demonstrating their increased professional versatility through Agile tools and 
techniques .

Expert Viewpoints: Scrum Master Job 
Environment

Welcome to expert viewpoints, Scrum Master Job Environment.
In this video we will hear Agile and Scrum experts discuss the opportunities for
a Scrum Master outside of the IT industry and any tips that they can give to make a Scrum master's 
resume more attractive to
prospective employers.
Agile and Scrum can absolutely be used outside of software development.
But in my experience the application is usually a bit different and the framework needs to be 
tweaked to fit the work.
This is where a knowledgeable Scrum master is incredibly valuable.
To make your resume more attractive to potential employers, tie your experience to quantifiable 
metrics and tangible outcomes.
And if you're just starting out, you don't have Scrum Master experience, tailor the wording of the 
experience you do have like say for traditional projects to show the relevancy to what's in the job 
description.
Yes, definitely, in my previous role I was a Scrum Master for our marketing team
and it worked very well in helping us deliver value to the organization.
What tips can you provide to make sure your Scrum master resume is more
attractive to prospective employers?
What I would suggest to make your resume more attractive to employers is highlight
your leadership abilities and communication skills.
Include any tools or technologies you are proficient in, such as Jira, Trello, Mural.
And showcase your problem solving skills and demonstrate your commitment to continuous 
learning and professional development.
Absolutely, I started doing this in the automotive industry and it worked just fine.
Anytime you see situations where you have uncertain requirements, where an iterative
process makes more sense, then this type of approach can be applied.
The challenge you're going to face is that not every organization uses Scrum.
So you may be the one to introduce it and sell it and explain how using an iterative process is very 
effective when you have uncertain requirements, the need for agility, and anytime you have the 
possibility that you would be better off delivering in small increments.
It's a good thing to consider, so if you're looking for a position outside the IT industry, there are 
many opportunities for that.
And if even if you come in as a project manager, you can still help the organization evolve to 
adopting Scrum or Agile as a way of doing projects.
It's all about value and people's time and if you can convince the organization or show them that it's 
value added then you can use this method.
>> Yes, there are opportunities for a Scrum Master outside the IT industry.
While Agile and Scrum have gained popularity in software development.
The principles and practices can be applied to various industries such as HR, finance and 
manufacturing.
The focus on collaboration, iterative development and delivering value can benefit any organization 
embracing Agile methodologies.
Personally, I have used Agile outside IT in marketing department and have successfully delivered 
lot of projects.
>> Many leading universities, for example are using Scrum to increase organizational effectiveness 
and launch new educational programs.
I can personally substantiate this through my course development work through the Northwest 
University Master's programs I personally support.
Many automotive companies have turned to Scrum to speed up the pace of innovation.
Many construction companies use Scrum to ensure effective collaboration and communication and 
align all milestones toward the final goal to be accomplished.
Marketing companies are turning to Scrum more and more to improve their outreach.
And information gathering capabilities through technical process improvements and
upgrades.
Even the event planning industry has adopted Scrum for those events where there is high 
complexity and less than complete agreement on what the event should include.
Product managers are using Scrum more and more where it makes sense to improve and
speed up traditionally slow and cumbersome product manufacturing systems.
Finally, the finance industry is using Scrum to keep up with the increasingly complex customer 
expectations.
And believe it or not, even the military is embracing Scrum to better plan and execute critical 
national security operations.
>> There are definitely, obviously, so many opportunities for Scrum Masters outside the IT industry.
Today, marketing industries, airline industries, farming, to name a few, are looking for Scrum 
masters.
So definitely go in for it if there's something that you're passionate about.
>> I'd say emphasize leadership,
especially if you're coming in without any direct Scrum Master experience.
Emphasize your leadership ability and project management experience is good.
Most of the time when you go work in a job, you end up naturally managing projects.
And it's on a lot of job descriptions about doing project management, so chances are you've already 
done that.
Now emphasize that on your resume and if you've done Scrum, of course, emphasize that as well.
Or Agile, or any type of coordination, any type of management or leadership, and you've probably 
done it and not even known it.
Now think about that and bring that out, articulate that on your resume.
>> To make your Scrum Master resume more attractive to prospective employers, try highlighting 
relevant Agile and Scrum certifications.
Emphasize your experience in facilitating Agile ceremonies and fostering team collaboration.
Showcase your ability to drive continuous improvement and implement Agile best practices.
Demonstrate strong communication and leadership skills, and highlight successful Agile project 
delivered by you and the outcomes.
You can also mention that you are part of the Agile project if you haven't delivered one.
>> So our first tips, number one keep your resume short, one page is perfect.
In addition, ensure the hard hitting information about you is in that top one third of your resume.
Next, do some research on Scrum and Scrum values, what values do you possess that match the 
Scrum Values model?
Kick off your resume with a short but compelling statement showing your passion for the Scrum 
Mastercraft and the problems you hope to solve.
Share history that shows how you were able to effectively work on a high performing team.
In addition, share history on how you have effectively managed up in the past and been able to 
influence without authority.
Do share your training and certifications, they are not what you should lead with.
But do show the prospective employer that you take learning seriously and are actively trying to 
improve your skill set.
>> What I always advise is that try to get experience from multiple industries and by that I mean get 
some experience from health, from banking and other things like oil and gas.
Then do as many certifications as you possibly can, that way when an employer looks at your 
resume, they see your experience, they see your certifications.
And they know that this is somebody that is coming into the company with a wealth of knowledge.

Expert Viewpoints: Advice for Aspiring Scrum 
Masters

Welcome to Expert Viewpoints, should you become a Scrum Master?
In this video, we will hear Agile and Scrum experts discuss who should pursue the job of Scrum 
Master, some of the challenges Scrum Masters encounter, and how they overcame these challenges.
The job of a Scrum Master is ideally suited for people who have a genuine interest and passion for 
Agile principles in the Scrum framework.
Those who have strong communication skills, have a servant leadership mindset, possess strong 
facilitation and coaching skills, love solving problems, and of course, are a continuous learner.
Some of the common challenges a Scrum Master faces are an organization or team members who 
are resistant to change or just lack the Agile experience or understanding.
Sometimes there's different personalities on a Scrum team that can present challenges.
Scaling Agile can present challenges and sometimes you can lack empowerment or support from 
management and stakeholders.
To overcome these challenges, you could conduct workshops or training sessions to share the 
benefits of Agile and Scrum.
You can be a role model for your team, you can have effective facilitation techniques to encourage 
open communication among team members, and you can engage stakeholders early and often.
And of course, seek support from fellow Scrum Masters in your organization.
Someone who has worked in a software development environment.
Someone who has a passion for working with teams that deliver value.
Someone who has project management experience, someone who's just overall passionate about 
agility.
If this is you, then I definitely advise that you can pursue a career as a Scrum Master.
In my opinion, the greatest challenge is knowing where to start, so what courses to take, how to go 
about them.
And finally, when you figure that out and you have a job, it's finding a team that will accept you as 
a new Scrum Master.
Especially if this team is used to having a very seasoned Scrum Master as part of them, that can be a 
huge challenge.
The way I overcame these challenges is first of all by understanding that I didn't know the process, I 
didn't know what's going on and putting in all the work.
So I took so many courses on Udemy, I watched YouTube videos, I read so many books, a lot.
I took a lot of time to invest in this because I knew that this was something that I was passionate 
about.
And when I joined my first team, first of all, I made them to understand that I'm here to support 
them and not to control them, that is very important.
Then I made sure to do my one on ones, make them to understand that I don't know the process, but 
I'm here to understand the process, here to learn, so that together we can all succeed and be valuable 
to our customer.
To me this is simple, anyone who loves to coach with a team and stakeholders.
If you're into the idea of building successful teams, then being a Scrum Master is a perfect 
opportunity to do that.
You have lots of chances to help a team who's struggling, help a team who's frustrated, help a team 
who is about to give up, who may not even get along with each other.
If you're into fixing those type of issues, then you may be very successful as a Scrum Master, 
especially if you're good at it.
If you're into solving complex problems, Scrum Master is a great opportunity to do that.
If you like helping support discouraged team members, you'll do lots of that as a Scrum Master.
You'll encounter all kinds of challenges, a little bit of everything.
You may find some unmotivated employees, someone who thinks that their way is the best,
a team of people who are experiencing group think.
You will see all kinds of different motives from your team members.
You'll find that teams don't even want to work together.
And an example would be a team who cannot agree on how to complete their tasks.
Maybe it's testing or development or some technical detail.
You'll encounter those things and they may or may not look at you for guidance, but nevertheless,
it is your responsibility to figure out those problems.
It's simple, be true to the Scrum process, it works.
Now, you may need to adapt to the organizational culture and things that feel natural to the team, 
but stay true to the framework, be true to the tools and techniques that you know that work.
Coaching, supporting, delegating, directing, you will need to do all those different things.
Be sensitive to what the team is telling you, this is a really key point.
They may not even verbally tell you directly, but you may hear it in their communication, their tone 
of voice, their interactions with each other, how they're participating in the meetings, how they're 
working with each other, the rate of the tasks that they're completing, the way they're doing their 
work.
You have to keep an ear to the ground and be sensitive to all those different types of indicators.
A good Scrum Master is an enabler, supports and coaches the team, so isn't going to get much 
recognition.
So if you need the spotlight, this probably isn't for you.
If you like helping people, are a good listener, and can handle uncertainty, you'll do fine.
Another skill you'll need is to be able to influence without authority.
It's much easier to be able to say do it because I told you to, but that won't work here.
So my favourite way to influence is to ask a lot of questions, tease out why decisions were made 
and maybe what other options they considered.
This is very useful in coaching.



Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum

Welcome to Introduction to Agile Development and Scrum.
I'm John Rofrano, and I'll be your instructor throughout this course that not only teaches
you what agile is, but introduces you to the tools and techniques that I have used over
the years, to become Agile.
According to Project Management Institute, more than 70 percent of organizations have
incorporated some Agile approaches and 77% of companies adopt scrum.
Additionally, more than 25 percent of manufacturing firms use Agile exclusively.
And based on research from Price Waterhouse Coopers, Agile projects are 28% more successful
than traditional projects.
Unfortunately, 47% of all Agile transformations fail, according to Forbes.
47%... that's almost half.
Why do you think that is?
One study by VersionOne shows the number one reason Agile projects fail is inexperience
with implementing and integrating the Agile methodology.
You see, Agile is not just a process that you follow.
It's a mindset that you become.
It's a philosophy that requires you to think differently about managing teams and projects.
Executive leadership needs to change their long-term focus and instead focus on delivering
value quickly and iteratively to delight their customers.
In order to succeed at becoming agile, you must change the company culture.
Another reason Agile projects fail is that Agile is not something you can simply learn
from a book.
I like to use the analogy of learning how to drive a car.
Those of you who drive know that they don't give you the keys to the car and the owner's
manual and say, "Here, go learn how to drive."
Someone who has driven before usually goes out with you, sitting in the passenger seat,
telling you what to watch out for and how hard to press on the gas or the brake pedal.
You have to practice with an instructor to acquire the skills to drive.
Agile is a lot like that.
For this course, I will be instructing you on not only what to do, but what to look out
for.
We will discuss both patterns and anti-patterns because recognizing when something is wrong
is just as important as knowing how to do something right.
You will learn the importance of being organized into small, co-located, cross-functional teams
and how to empower your teams to be self-managing so they can make decisions faster.
I will teach you how to perform agile planning with practical examples taken from software
development that you can apply to your own situation, regardless of what you are developing.
You will see how concepts from lean manufacturing have found their way into Agile and scrum,
and how at the end of every iteration you should ask yourself, "Do we pivot, or persevere?"
In other words, should we change course and try something new, or keep going the way you
are?
This course will equip you with what you need to be successful in implementing Agile in
your organization.
So, absorb the videos, reinforce your learning with the quizzes, and use the discussion forums
to talk with your peers and classmates.
Like anything else, the more you practice, the better you get, so make sure you challenge
yourself to complete the hands-on honours module at the end and start building your Agile planning
skills.
Congratulations on embarking on this exciting journey, and good luck!
Agile Principles

After watching this video, you'll be able to define the Agile philosophy, describe the characteristics 
of Agile, and explain the philosophy of the Agile Manifesto.
So, what is Agile? Agile is an iterative approach to project management that allows teams to be
responsive and deliver value to their customers quickly. Notice I said iterative. Unlike other
planning approaches where we plan out an entire year's worth of work, with Agile, we plan out
small increments, and they get feedback from the customer to see if they like what we're doing.
And then we adjust as we go along. So what are some defining characteristics? Well, Agile 
emphasizes this adaptive planning. As I said, we don't plan out an entire year, we just plan out a 
small iteration, to see if we can deliver something of value to the customer, and get feedback and 
see what they like. That allows us to do evolutionary development. So our development is evolving 
over time. We're building... instead of building the whole thing up at once, we're building it in small 
increments. And then we evolve as we go and respond as we go. This gives us the opportunity to do 
early delivery, very key. If you're developing iterations, and you're not delivering to your customer, 
you're not being agile, early delivery is a key component of being agile. Putting something in the 
customers' hands, getting feedback from them to understand, do they like it? Should we pivot, 
should we persevere? This is really, really a critical defining characteristic of being agile, over just 
doing iterative development. That leads us to continuous improvement. So now we can 
continuously improve as a team. We continuously improve the product that we're delivering, right, 
because we have the opportunity to get feedback from our customer, because we delivered it. And 
that allows us to be responsive to change. So as changes happen, and changes always do, customers 
always have changing requirements. We can respond to those changes, because we haven't planned 
too far in advance, the customer sees the progress we've made, and then we can re-plan very, very 
quickly, and be responsive to what a customer needs.
This brings us to the Agile Manifesto. The Agile Manifesto says we have come to value individuals
and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation,
customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.
This is the important part. That is, while there's value in the items on the right, we value the items 
on the left more. It doesn't mean that we don't have processing tools, it just means that we value 
interacting amongst ourselves and with our customers more than the process and tools. It doesn't 
mean we don't document. Documentation is important so that people understand how to use your 
product. But we can't ship documentation. So let's not lose the focus.
Working software is what we're here to deliver. It doesn't mean that we don't negotiate contracts,
we still have contracts, but we want to collaborate with the customer. As things change, we want to 
be responsive, which means not that we don't have plans, but we value responding to change over 
simply following the plan.
Agile software development then is an iterative approach to software development that conforms to
the Agile Manifesto. We want to make sure that we're keeping those four things in the manifesto,
you know, on our minds a whole time. We also want to make sure that we emphasize flexibility,
interacting with our peers, interacting with our customer, and having a high level of transparency, so 
that everybody knows what everyone else is working on.
Everybody feels responsible for delivering value to the customers. This is critically important.
And then finally, we use small, co-located, cross-functional, self-organizing, self-managing teams, 
we're going to talk a lot about this during this course.
The key takeaway here is to build what is needed, not what was planned. If you build what was
planned and the customer doesn't like it, why did you bother building it? It's really, really
important to make sure that as they needs change, and they will, you want to build what's needed 
from the
customer regardless of what was planned. We could always replan and be responsive to change.

In this video, you learn that Agile is an iterative, collaborative approach to software development
using small cross functional teams. The Agile approach emphasizes flexibility, interactivity,
and transparency. The Agile Manifesto describes the core values of Agile: Individuals and
interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation,
customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan.

Methodologies Overview

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe the Waterfall approach to software
development.
Explain the problems with the Waterfall approach, describe Extreme Programming approach, list
of values of XP approach, define Kanban, and list its core principles.
So, let's take a look at a traditional Waterfall development.
It all starts out with a requirements phase. People are gathering requirements, seeing what the 
customer wants, making sure that we're going to deliver something that the customer wants. At least 
for that point in time.
And so this is a phase where all you're doing is documenting all the requirements of the customer 
might want in the system. Then you move on to the design phase.
Notice I'm using the term phases here.
This is very important, because there was exit criteria and entrance criteria to move from one phase 
to the other.
So once we've got all the requirements, we move on to the design, hoping that we have all the 
requirements that we actually need.
So then in the design phase, the architects are designing. They're figuring out how do we take those 
requirements, turn them into working software, and so they design the entire system.
And then once that phase is done, we move on to the coding phase.
So this is where the developers are hackety hacking coding away.
Now, you'll notice this is called Waterfall and those arrows are flowing down.
because it's really hard to swim up a waterfall.
This is an appropriate name.
Because when you're in the coding phase, and you find out, this is a bad design, it doesn't work, it's 
real hard to go back up and redesign things.
In fact, because we treat software development like civil engineering projects, sometimes
some of those designers have moved on to the next project, and you've got to go find them.
So very, very difficult to go back and swim with the waterfall.
Then after coding, we finally get to integrate.
So all along, we're coding in isolation, we're not integrating my module with the next person's 
module. You know, there's a time when all those modules come together. The first time we realized, 
do all these pieces of code even work together?
And then we move on to the testing phase, because now we've got a system that people can test.
And as they find bugs, they got to go back, swim up the waterfall, and open some bugs in the 
coding phase and do some recoding.
And then if one of those bugs that they tested, turns out to be, you really need to change the design 
because these things aren't interacting well, way, way up the waterfall, very expensive to go back up 
to the design phase.
And then finally, after all the testing is done, we deploy the software.
So what's wrong with this approach?
Well, there's no provision for change.
Every phase has entrance and exit criteria.
And when one ends, you know, the next one begins.
And there's just no provision for going back and changing the design or changing the requirements
or anything like that.
So the other problem is, you don't know if it works to the end, right, there's no intermediate 
delivery. Nothing is delivered, until that last step, when we give it to the operations team and say, go 
deliver this thing into production.
The other is that each step ends when the next one begins, that's where it got this waterfall name, 
where things are just passed down.
And of course, every one of these is an opportunity to lose information, you know, and to have
a mishap happen or to have people get blocked, because they can't accept, you know, the work
from the previous phase.
And now you're waiting to get that next phase going.
The other is that mistakes are found later on are very, very costly, very costly to find something 
that's designed wrong and testing and go back and redesign it.
And then finally, there's the long lead times, right between getting that software delivered. From the 
time you first want the software, and you design the software and code it and test it.
And by the time you finally deliver it long, long, long lead times.
So the problem here is teams are working separately, they're unaware of their impact to each other.
Right, designers are unaware of the impact of the code, the coders are unaware of their impact to 
integrating all the code together.
There everybody's working in their little silos for their little phase.
And then this should be a scary thought.
The people who are furthest away from a code, the poor operations team, have to run this and 
manage this in production, right?
They know the least about the code, and they're the ones who are expected to run it.
Not very efficient.


Let's talk about another methodology, extreme programming.
This was introduced back in 96.
Kent Beck introduced this and if you look at the graphic on the right, you'll see that it is very 
iterative and talking about loops.
You've got these major release plan on the outer loop.
And then you've got an iteration plan.
And so the release maybe months, the iterations maybe weeks,
acceptance has maybe days, stand up meetings once a day, right, pair negotiation in hours,
unit testing in minutes, pair programming in seconds.
You know, it's these tighter and tighter loops of doing work and then getting fast feedback.
It's based on an iterative approach to software development.
And in fact, this is where Agile got it from.
And the intent here is to improve software quality, right? Be responsive to change, be
responsive to customer requirements, do things in small increments.
And so many people recognize Extreme Program as one of the first Agile methods.
So let's talk about Extreme Programming values.
First is simplicity, right?
Do what you need
and no more, don't over-engineer, don't over code, don't deliver more code than the customer
asked for.
Keep it simple, very important.
The next one is communication.
Everyone on the team should be communicating know what everyone else is doing, it fosters
a lot, a lot of communication, and people interacting. Very important as well.
And then feedback, you have no idea how you're doing unless you're getting feedback.
So having those feedback loops are critical to extreme programming, and critical to Agile
in general.
And then respect, everyone feels that they are respected on the team, that they can offer
advice that they can make suggestions, and that their suggestions are just as valuable
as anybody else's suggestion on the team.
There's no hierarchy, everybody has peers on the team, and respected for their ideas.
And then finally, courage, right, we don't pad our estimates, we're just very honest
about we think we could do this
And we don't think we can do that.
And we're not going to lie to you that we you know, we can get this, this done in this
amount of time.
We're very open and honest in Extreme Programming on, these are the estimates, this is what we'll 
commit to.
Next, there's Kanban.
This comes from the Japanese manufacturing systems.
And kanban literally means billboard sign, and it's all about continuous flow on the
manufacturing floor, where these cards or notes would flow with the product from station
to station, going down the line.
So the core principle with Kanban are visualize the workflow.
If you can't see the work, you can't manage the work.
And this is something we take into Agile too. You're going to find out we're going
to use Kanban boards and Agile.
And it's all about visualizing the work, very important that you can understand the work
that needs to be done, and everything is accounted for. Kanban also stresses limit the work in
progress. You don't want, when you're on a manufacturing floor, you don't want work to back up at 
one
of the stations.
But even when you're developing software, you don't want to have people working on too
many things at once.
Because, you know, you can only ship 100% of one thing that's working, you can't ship
50% of two things.
And so if you got one person working on two things, it's not good.
And that comes from Kanban to limit the work in progress.
Then there's managing and enhancing the flow. In Kanban, they're always looking to improve.
They're always looking to change and understand how can we get a better flow, a quicker flow
on the manufacturing floor, and then making policies explicit, so that everyone understands
how things work.
And everyone understands the definition of "done," what does it mean to have something be
"done." We take that also from Kanban in our Agile planning to understand what the definition
of"done" is.
And then continuously improving, very, very important to get feedback and continuously
improve on what you're doing.
So Kanban is all about making the flows work better, understanding them, seeing them,
being able to measure them, and then continuously improving on how we can flow faster.

In this video, you learn that your traditional Waterfall approach to software development
is a structured, step-by-step process that can lead to problems not surfaced until later
in development.
The extreme programming was developed to improve software quality and responsiveness to 
changing
requirements.
XP values include simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage.
Kanban is a system characterized by visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, managing
and enhancing the flow, making process policies explicit and continuously improving the process.

Working Agile

After watching this video, you'll be able to list the five practices of working Agile,
explain working in small batches, define a minimum viable product, understand behaviour
driven development, understand test driven development, explain how pair programming works.
So let's take a look at what it really means to work in an Agile fashion. First, you want to work in
small batches. We get this from lean manufacturing. You don't want to make a big batch of 
something
and then find out that you did it wrong because that's a lot of waste having to go back and change
it. Next, you want to use minimum viable products to figure out what does the customer like, what
doesn't the customer like. And then you want to use practices like behaviour driven development
and test driven development to improve your testing of the system from the outside in and
from the inside out. And then finally you want to take advantage of pair programming. This came
from extreme programming but pair programming is critically important. So we're going to look at
each one of these in turn. Working in small batches-- let's say I need to mail out a thousand 
brochures.
And the steps are you need to fold the brochures and then insert the brochures into envelopes,
and then seal the envelopes and then finally stamp the envelopes with postage.
So let's say that we're going to do these thousand in batches of 50, right, big batches, 50 a piece and
assume that each step takes about six seconds to complete. So I can do about 10 steps per minute.
And so we do the first step folding, right? And at 10 for a minute, it takes me about five minutes to
fold 50 of them. Then I move on to the next step. The next step is inserting them all and again,
if I could do about 10 of them per minute, and so it takes me five more minutes, plus the five 
minutes from before. Now I'm 10 minutes into it. I've got them all folded and inserted then I move 
on to step three sealing them all, right? So now again about 10 per minute I could do another 50 in 
another five minutes. So I'm up to 15 minutes, right? Wall clock time. And then finally I get to step 
four and it took me 16 minutes to get my first finished product right?
The first one where I had things that I could actually inspect it and see what the quality was.
So, what if the envelopes had no glue, right? It would be 11 minutes before I figure out that 
something went wrong. What if there's a typo on the brochure? I have to go all the way back to the 
beginning, right? So, this is just very, very wasteful working in these large batches like this.
Now let's look at the same example with single piece flow. And again, assume each step takes about
six seconds to complete. With single piece flow, I fold, right? And put them in the envelope and
seal them and put a stamp on them and the first finished product is in about 24 seconds. Now I
can inspect it see if it works, see if it's what I thought it was, and then let the rest of the flow
rip. Now what if the envelopes had no glue? Well I would find out after, uh, maybe 18 seconds, 
right?
And if there was a typo in the brochure, after 24 seconds, so it's very, very important that we don't
work in two larger batches so that we can get fast feedback and that we can pivot and understand,
you know, do we need to do something different and then make the changes that we need to make?
So let's talk about minimum viable product. First, let's understand what it is not, because there's
a misconception that a minimum viable product is like phase one of the project or, you know,
the first beta or something like that. And it's not. This is not what a minimum viable product is.
A minimum viable product is the minimal thing that you can do to prove a hypothesis and gain
learning and gain understanding. The difference between these two is that the first one is all
about delivery, right? What am I going to deliver? But the second one is all about
learning. What can I learn? What can I learn from putting out this MVP and get feedback
and then maybe make the next one even better? So it's important that at the end of each MVP
you decide whether to pivot or persevere. Let's look at an example. Here's a team that's developing
a minimum viable product for a customer that wants a car. And so, in the first iteration, they deliver 
a
wheel. The customer's like, "What am I going to do with a wheel? I can't do anything with this?" 
Like,
well, we're working iterations, we're trying to be agile here, right? And so the next iteration, we'll
give you some more. And they give them a chassis and it's like, okay, "I really can't do anything
with this." And then finally, you know, they give them a car with no steering wheel and then
eventually they get the car, right? And so they get this coupe. That team did not understand
how to create a minimum viable product. They were just doing iterative development.
The second team understands the value of creating an MVP. At first, they give them
a skateboard and the customer's like, "I asked you for a car and you're giving me a skateboard."
Whoa, whoa we're testing the color. How do you like that color red? Is that the color you want? "Oh 
yeah,
red's kind of cool but you know it's really hard to steer." No, we'll fix that in the next MVP and
then they add a way to steer it and the customer's like, "Well, okay, you did give me a way to steer it
but I can't go very fast. I need a better form of locomotion." And then we'll deal with that in
the next MVP. In the next iteration, they give them pedals. Somewhere along the way while the 
customer
is riding on that motorcycle feeling the wind in their hair they decide, "I want a convertible." In the
first instance, the customer got exactly what they asked for months before because they were just
following a plan but in the second instance the customer got exactly what they desired
because they were working interactively with the development team and in the end, you develop
something that's a little bit different but it's closer to what the customer really, really wants.
Behavior driven development is when we describe the system from the outside in. This is usually
done at an integration testing level, right? So, this is where we're taking the customer's
view of the system usually when you're doing BDD testing, you're doing it against the user 
interface,
right? You're doing it against the thing that the customer sees to see if the system behaves the
way it's supposed to. So, if it's an e-commerce system, when I put something in my cart, does it
behave the way I want? When I transfer a cart to an order, does it behave the way I want? It's
really taking an outside-in approach. It's not too concerned with the things going on underneath.
The cool thing is it uses a single syntax that both the developers and the stakeholders can
use to describe the system and agree on the behavior of the system, on what the system does.
So, let's take a look at that syntax. It starts with these BDD feature scenarios. Where I say,
"As a sum role, so, I want to know who is this for. I need some function, right? So what is
it the functionality that we actually need so that I get some business value?" So, now you know
who is it for. Is it for the customers? For the system administrator, right? Who's getting the
value out of this what do they need and why do they need it? And that's the beginning of your
feature file. And then you start running through scenarios and here's where we use this common
syntax. It's known as Gherkin syntax after the Gherkin pickle. And it goes something like this:
Given a set of preconditions, right? So, that kind of sets up the scenario-- given that this is 
true.
I've got two items in my cart. I got three items that I order, whatever. When some event 
happens, right? So, that's the thing that's under test. Then I should see some observable 
outcome. So, using this given when-then syntax, developers can understand it, stakeholders 
can understand it, everybody can understand this common syntax that when I have something 
in my cart and then I clear my cart, you know, I should see nothing in my cart.
So very, very important to have the syntax in these BDD scenarios. Test-driven development is 
testing a system from the inside out. Unlike behavior-driven development. It is concerned with the 
internals of the system, the single modules. Usually this is called unit testing, right? And this is 
something that is unit test case driven and we want to make sure that given these inputs I get these 
outputs at a small module level. I don't know if when I put them all together I'm going to get the 
behavior I want. That's kind of BDD but for TDD, test driven development, I'm just testing the 
system way down at the unit level and so you write a test case first for the code you wish you had 
and then you write enough code to make that test case pass and then you start all over again and 
refactor. So the workflow goes something like this:
I write a test case. You might say, "You write test cases before you write the code?" Yeah this keeps 
me
featured on what is the code supposed to do. When I call this, how do I want to call this? What are 
the
parameters I think I want to pass in and then what does it do for me? So, you write the test case first
then you write enough code to make that test case pass and then once it passes then you can refactor
the code because now you have test cases to keep you honest, you'll know if you broke anything.
Now, because when the test case runs and it fails it usually turns red and then when it works
correctly it turns green; we tend to call this Red, Green, Refactor. Watch a test case, write a test case
watch it fail, make just write enough code to make it pass, and then refactor make it-- you might not
have made it very elegant just to make it pass-- now you can go back and you can add all sorts of
error checking and whatnot make it a little more, uh, robust and then run the test cases. Make sure
you didn't break anything. Pair programming. Pair programming, you might say two programmers 
working
together on the same thing, uh, and the first thing is: I'm paying two people to do one job?
But actually it works out really, really well because what you're doing is you've got one
person writing code and then you've got another person who has another set of eyes on the code.
So the question is, would you rather find bugs in production? Would you rather find bugs while 
you're
writing the code? It's a lot cheaper to find them while you're writing the code, so having two sets
of eyes, they check each other and they go back and forth. It's not just one and then the other.
Usually in 20 minute increments, right? Somebody's writing code, the other one is watching and 
they're
not just watching. Sometimes they're looking things up, sometimes they're discussing. "What do 
you think
I should call this variable? What do you think I should call this function?" Right? It's two sets of
minds working around this code and what happens is you actually get higher quality code at the end 
of
the day, right? The code quality goes up because two people have already checked it and so when
you say, "I can't afford to pay two people to write one piece of code." You can't afford not to pay 
two
people to write it because writing the code is the cheap part. Debugging it, maintaining in 
production,
that's the expensive part and so if you want the expensive part to get cheaper you want to have
your programmers do pair programming. It's also very good to put a senior programmer with a 
junior
programmer. Now the junior programmers can see: How does the senior programmer approach the 
problem?
And so they learn, they get mentorship, and then the senior program can see how the junior person
is making out. Or you get people who are unfamiliar with the code working with someone who is. 
Now you
get more people learning the code because they they're and they're getting like a tutorial from
the other person. So pair programming is really, really great way of bringing all your people on
your team up to a certain level. In this video you learn that working in small batches means
delivering something useful quickly, an MVP is the cheapest, easiest thing you can do to test the
hypothesis and learn. Behavior driven development makes sure you're building the right thing.
And test driven development makes sure you're building the thing right.
While pair programming enables you to discover defects earlier and increase your code quality.

Scrum Overview

After watching this video, you'll be able to distinguish between Agile and Scrum, define the
key characteristics of the Scrum methodology, and describe the steps in the Scrum process.
Agile and Scrum are two words that many people use interchangeably, but there really is a 
difference.
Agile is a philosophy. It is not perscriptive. It's a philosophy for doing work. Scrum
is a methodology. It is perscriptive. It's a methodology for working in an agile fashion. So,
what is Scrum? Well, it's a management framework for doing incremental product 
development.
It emphasizes small, cross-functional, self managing teams. And it provides a structure of
roles and rules, and artifacts, and we're going to learn about all of those. It also uses these 
fixed length increments that are called sprints. We're going to get into sprints in a moment. 
And it has a goal of building an increment each time through a sprint, a potentially shippable 
increment each time through that iteration. Very, very important that you get stuff in your 
customers' hands early.
So, I like to say, "Easy to understand, difficult to master." There's not a lot of rules in Scrum,
but somehow it's really, really hard to do. And I attribute it to being a ballerina, like,
all you have to do is dance on your toes, right? How hard could it be? Well, we all know
it takes years to gain the muscle memory and build up your muscles to be able to dance on your 
toes.
It's not as easy as it looks, and Scrum is the same way. Not as easy as it looks. So, my advice
is if you've never done it before, hire somebody on the team who has, have someone to guide you,
someone to mentor you, because it is a lot harder than it looks. So, let's talk about the sprint. A
sprint is one iteration through the design, code, test, deploy cycle, right? So, you're doing 
these mini iterations. It's kind of like the software delivery lifecycle. In a mini inner iteration.
Every sprint should have a goal, right? You should, everybody should, understand what is
it we're trying to build with this increment. What should this increment do at the end of the 
sprint?
And then the Sprints are usually two weeks long, some people say two to four weeks,
I find four weeks to be far too long. A lot of things can change in four weeks, right? 
Remember small, want to work in small batches. And so, I think it's really important to try to 
keep your sprints to two weeks, some people get them down to one. That's a little too fast for 
me, but two weeks seems to be a good goal to make your sprints. So, let's look at the steps in the 
scrum process.
You've got the product backlog. This is the list of all the stories of everything you ever want to do 
with your product. This is it, this is everything, it's kind of your to-do list of everything you might 
want to do. Then we've got something called backlog refinement, that's when we go through the 
product backlog. And we groom the stories to make sure that they're sprint ready because we want 
to start doing planning on those stories.
Then, we have a planning meeting where we produce a sprint backlog. Notice the sprint backlog 
is smaller than the product backlog. The sprint backlog is just those stories that we want to 
accomplish in the next sprint, in the next two weeks. So we take from that product backlog, pare it 
down into a sprint backlog of just the stories to execute in the next sprint. And then we start our two 
week sprints. And every day we get together and do the daily Scrum or the daily stand-up where 
everybody gets to answer three questions. What did you do yesterday? What are you going to do 
today? And is there anything blocking you or impeding you from getting up further? So you 
go through that every day for two weeks, build your sprint.
And then finally, hopefully, you've got a valuable shippable increment at the end of that process.
Agile development is iterative. You're going to go through this again and again.
Design, code, test, deploy, design, code, test, deploy. I mean, this is this is what you do in every 
sprint. And notice, you know, you've got to have some kind of deploy, it's not enough to just do 
design, code, and test, design, code without deploying it and getting feedback, right? So, so every 
sprint you make a plan, you go through the software delivery lifecycle cycle, and then you deploy 
that application and you get some feedback from the customer that is input to the next plan to go 
through the next cycle.

In this video, you learn that Scrum is a methodology that follows the Agile philosophy. The Scrum 
management framework provides structure through defined roles, meetings, rules and artifacts. It 
also prescribes small cross-functional, self-organizing teams. Uses fixed length iterations called 
sprints, and produces a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration.


The 3 Roles of Scrum

After watching this video, you'll be able to list the three rules of Scrum, explain what a product 
owner does, explain what a Scrum master does, and explain what a Scrum team does.
There are only three roles in Scrum. It starts with the product owner. That's the person who has
the vision. That's the person who calls the shots. They're the one who decides to pivot or persevere.
Often I get asked the question, what's the difference between a product manager and a product
owner? It's pretty simple. A product manager is a job title, a product owner is a Scrum role. Your
product manager might be your product owner, might not be a product owner. Don't get them 
confused.
This is a role in Scrum. Then, there's the Scrum master. We want them to be mentors, right? We 
want them to be the smartest person about Scrum on the team to help the rest of the team implement 
Scrum.
So that is somebody that you want to be guiding the team. If you don't have an experienced Scrum
Master, get one because that can make or break a team. If you've got experienced teams, maybe
they don't need an experienced Scrum master, but if you've got a team just starting out in Scrum,
I recommend the Scrum master be experienced. And then there's the Scrum team, or sometimes 
called the development team, not to be confused with the team of software engineers. The 
development team are the people who are developing whatever it is you're delivering. They could 
be software engineers, testers, operations folks, business analysts, whoever it is, that's part of the 
team that's delivering the product increment. So, let's dig deeper into each one of these roles to see
what they do.
The product owner, they represent the stakeholder interest. If there's any questions
about what the stakeholders want, you should go to the product owner, you don't need to go to
the stakeholder. Who is a stakeholder? it's usually the person with the checkbook. It's the person 
who is funding whatever it is that you're doing, right? They're the one at the end of the day
that are paying you to do it. But this product owner is the liaison between the Scrum team and
the stakeholders and their interests. They also articulate the product vision, this is very key.
Product owners have to have a vision of where they're going. It's really, really important.
And when and they should articulate that vision to the team, so the whole team knows where they're
going. They are the final arbiter of requirements or questions, you have, any questions on the
requirements, don't need to go to the stakeholders, you go to the product owner, they are the liaison.
And they constantly reprioritize the product backlog, adjusting any expectations. And so,
every time through a sprint, we go through the product backlog, the product owner, maybe the
Scrum master, will go through the product backlog, and they will reprioritize and they will groom
these stories and make them give them more detail. So, that is one of the jobs of the product owner,
making sure that backlog is sprint ready. They also accept or reject each product increment.
So that's the person that says "Yep, let's go with it. Let's ship it," or "Not quite what the customer
asked for. You know, let's try again, we'll write some more stories and, and try to get
it right the next time." So, they decide whether to ship, it's their sole responsibility. They
decide whether to continue development, maybe you don't need to persevere, maybe you need to 
pivot, maybe you need to do something different. So they would make that decision as well.

The Scrum master facilitates the Scrum process; they should be the smartest person in the room
about Scrum. It's very important to have an experienced Scrum master if you have an inexperienced 
team. If you have a very experienced team in Scrum, you might not need a very experienced Scrum 
master. Or you might have a Scrum master between a couple of teams that are experienced because 
they don't need a lot of his time.
They coach the team, we want them to be Agile coaches, right? We want them to be mentors,
we want them to help the team through the Scrum process. They create an environment that allows
the team to be self-organizing, right? So, the team decides what they do. They're the ones that are 
going to commit to a sprint increment. And the Scrum master has to make sure that the team has the 
ability and the environment in which they can do that and be self-organizing.
They also shield the team from external interferences, right? Keep them in the zone.
So, if customers are grabbing team members or stakeholders or calling team members, you know, 
the Scrum master needs to stop that. They need to say, "If you need something, you come to me.
Alright? Let the team alone. Let them do the work they need to do."
They also help resolve impediments. We're going to find that we do a daily stand up.
And the three questions we ask during that stand up are: What did you do yesterday? What are 
you getting done today? And are there any impediments? If anyone on the team has an 
impediment it is the Scrum master's highest priority that day to get them unblocked,
to remove that impediment. Very, very, very important. It's very different than traditional
project management, where a project manager, if you've told me "I have impediment," they'll ask 
you, "What are you going to do about it?" That's not the Scrum master's job, the Scrum master's job 
to say "I will. Give that impediment to me, I will get it fixed you move on to some more productive 
work."
They also enforce the sprint time boxes, right? So you've got the 15 minute daily stand-up, and
they make sure it stays at 15 minutes, right? And all the other Scrum meetings, they make sure that
they're timebox, the two week sprint, make sure we don't go over the two weeks during the sprint.
They capture empirical data, maybe adjust forecasts, right? So, they're the one who's
making sure, looking at burndown charts, and making sure that the team is going to reach their 
goals.
And they should have no management authority over the team. And I get a lot of questions 
about this, you know, why can't they be a manager? Well, the Scrum master has to be, if you will,
a friend to the team, right? A coach to the team. And it's a very unique manager, you know, that the
team members can come to and tell them, you know, "I don't feel I have enough training for this,"
or "I don't feel like I'm good enough to do that," or whatever. They need somebody that can confide
in. And usually that's not a management person or somebody you know, who controls that person's
salary. And so, they need to be there to lend an ear and to help the team. So, I recommend that they
not be a manager of the team, they be somebody else that the team can confide in.
Then there's the Scrum team themselves. This is a cross-functional team, consists of developers,
testers, business analysts, domain experts, operations people, if you're doing DevOps,
I mean, it's a cross-functional team very, very, very important that it's not just software engineers, 
like we used to do traditionally, when we did Waterfall development. The Scrum team is self-
organizing, there's no externally assigned roles. Everybody is equal. Everybody has the same role. 
They're part of the Scrum team. They are self-managing, they self-assign themselves work. So, 
when you're looking at, you know, the kanban board, and you're saying, "Well, how do I know if 
somebody, I've assigned enough work to somebody?" The answer is you don't because you don't 
assign work to anyone. The Scrum team pulls the work off of the kanban board, assigns it to 
themselves and starts working on it. Very, very different. So, why say you know, Scrum, easy to 
understand, difficult to master. Some people can't get the hang of this, but this is how it works, 
you've got to let them be self-managing. Now, they shouldn't be too large. A Scrum team is seven 
plus or minus two. I've heard some people say five plus or minus two.
But the idea is that they're small, they're not 20-25 people. They should be co-located, if at all
possible. They are most successful when they're co-located. There is empirical data for that,
right? They just are more successful when people together, hopefully in the same team room,
but if they can't be, my recommendation is if the team has to be geographically dispersed,
put at least two members in a geography or time zone so that they can collaborate together.
And then maybe I'll have other people a team in another timezone. Don't just stick one person
alone in a time zone, they kind of get forgotten about, and it's really not fair to them.
You need people to collaborate with-- very, very, very important. And then they're dedicated. Most
successful teams have long-term, full-time members. They're not on multiple projects.
They're not getting pulled off for other projects. You know, I've said, I've stood in meetings,
daily stand ups, where someone says, "What do you do yesterday?" and they say, "My manager
pulled me off to do something else. I didn't get anything done for this project yesterday."
That is a sign that you're in trouble, right? You do not want to have people on multiple projects,
you want them to be dedicated if you want to be a high performing, successful team.
They negotiate commitments with the product owner, one sprint at a time. They're not committing 
for what they're going to do down the road. They're not committing in January for what they're 
going to do in September, they're going to commit. "What am I gonna get done in the next two 
weeks?" And they've got a ton of autonomy on how to reach those commitments. So, they're not 
told how to do something. They're told what needs to get done, and then get out of their way. You 
hired good people, let them do their thing and let them figure out how to get that thing done.

In this video, you learn that the product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the
product vision, and decides priorities, requirements, and readiness to ship.
The Scrum master coaches the team, promotes a cooperative environment, shielding the team
from interference and unblocking impediments. The Scrum team is small, dedicated, co-located, 
cross- functional, and self-managing. The Scrum team negotiates commitments with the product 
owner one sprint at a time. The Scrum team has autonomy regarding how to reach its commitments.

Artifacts, Events, and Benefits

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe the three Scrum artifacts, explain
the five Scrum events, and discuss the benefits of Scrum. Let's take a look at the artifacts
of Scrum. The first is the product backlog. This is a list of all the stories you're ever going to want 
to do. It's all your requirements for the product that haven't been done yet.
So any stories that are not in the current sprint, are in the product backlog. Some teams have a 
product backlog and an icebox and a release backlog. But for the most part, we'll call those all the 
product backlog, everything you ever going to do in the future. Then there's the sprint backlog. 
Those are the stories that you're going to do in the next two weeks, in the next sprint. So, those are 
stories that are kind of on deck to be executed. And then you've got a done increment. A done 
increment is a product increment that is completed by the end of a sprint. And so, you work for two 
weeks in a sprint. And then, hopefully, at the end of that, you've got a complete or done increment. 
Scrum has five events.
The first is the sprint planning meeting.
That's where you get together to plan out the sprint. In that meeting, you'll have the product owner 
and the Scrum master and the entire team planning out what to do next, where the team commits to 
the stories that they're going to fulfill in the next sprint.
Then you've got the daily Scrum or daily stand-up meeting.
And this happens every day, right? Usually in the same place, same time, where they meet to kind 
of synchronize on how are we doing? What are we going to get done today? And does anybody 
have any impediments that can be relieved by the Scrum master?
Then there's the sprint itself, right?
That is the two weeks in which everybody is working. And then at the end of the sprint,
you have a sprint review. That's demo time. That's when you demonstrate what you've done to 
the stakeholders so they could see the advancements that you've gotten, the new features that 
you've put in the product. And then finally, and most importantly, is the Sprint retrospective. 
That retrospective is where the team reflects on what went well what didn't go well, what can 
we change for the future?
So, what are some of the benefits of using Scrum? Well, higher productivity, right? When 
everybody is meeting every day to understand what to do when we've got a Kanban board, with all 
our work in progress, everyone can see what everyone's working on. It lends itself to higher 
productivity, because people are kind of self-managing and being very productive. Also, better 
quality, right?
Better software quality, because the team is engaged in what they're doing. They're running tests, 
they're using behavior driven development, they're using test driven development, right? And they 
are getting higher quality out of their, out of the code that they're writing because they're constantly 
testing it.
You get reduced time to market because you're working in small increments. So, small increments
mean, I get something done, I get a done increment sooner that I can then put out and have 
customers test and have customers enjoy.
You're also increasing stakeholder satisfaction, because they're not waiting months and months 
and months to see if whatever you build is what they want. They get to see it much quicker, that 
makes them much happier.
And then, of course, you get better team dynamics because it's transparent. Everyone knows what 
everyone's working on. Everybody chips in when somebody gets stuck. It's really, really a better 
environment and a more productive environment for developers to be working in.
And finally, that leads to happier employees, right? Employees understand that they are in control. 
They are pulling things off the backlog. They're committing to a sprint, one sprint plan at a time, 
and so they feel more in control and they feel happier about their jobs.



I want to take a look for a moment at Scrum versus Kanban. We're going to use a Kanban board in 
Scrum, but we're not going to follow the whole Kanban process. So, I just want to show you what's 
different about it. When we talk about Scrum and talk about Kanban.
First there's the cadence. Scrum uses fixed length sprints, usually two weeks in in duration.
Kanban is continuous flow. It's something you would do on a manufacturing floor, right?
You don't produce a batch of cars every two weeks. You have cars coming off the assembly line all 
day long. The release methodologies are different, right? Scrum releases at the end of a sprint and 
Kanban does continuous delivery. And so, some teams do software and follow Kanban where they 
continually deliver code. Whenever the code is ready they push it out. They don't wait to the end of 
a sprint. But Scrum uses these fixed length sprints to do release. And then there's the roles. I've just 
shown you that we have product owners and Scrum masters and development teams in Scrum, there 
are no real roles. There could be an Agile coach in Kanban but there are no roles in Kanban. There 
are just the people who are working to produce what it ever is you're producing. Then the key 
metrics in Scrum is velocity. We haven't learned about velocity yet, but velocity is how much work
a team can get done in two weeks. Kanban looks at cycle time, you know, how long does it take 
from inception to getting something you know, off of the assembly line, right from beginning to 
end? What are my cycle times, you know, maybe getting an order from a customer and actually 
producing the number of things that are in that order. And then there's a change in philosophy, right? 
In Scrum, teams should strive not to make changes to the sprint forecast during the sprint. 
Sometimes it happens, sometimes you have to do it. But what you want to do is that two weeks is 
locked in and if anything else needs to be done, we'll address it at the end of the two weeks. 
Whereas, Kanban change can happen at any time. They're continuously improving, continuously 
changing, and anyone can decide there's a defect in something and make a change and change the 
process and keep going. There's no limit to the change philosophy.

In this video, you learned that Scrum produces a product backlog, a sprint backlog, a complete or 
done increment. The Scrum events are sprint planning, daily Scrum meetings, sprints, sprint 
reviews, and sprint retrospectives. If done well, Scrum can increase employee productivity, 
happiness, improve product quality, reduce time to market and enhance stakeholder satisfaction.

Organizational impact of Agile

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe how proper organization contributes
to success, explain how team should be aligned, explain why autonomy is important,
and discuss why the entire organization must adopt Agile to be effective.
I can't stress enough how critical organization is to success. A lot of companies don't understand 
this. They go in with their existing teams, and they think they're going to make those teams agile. 
But what they don't realize is that your existing teams may need to be reorganized in order to take 
full advantage of becoming agile. Back in 1968, Melvin Conway made a statement that is now 
known as Conway's Law. Any organization that designs a system defined broadly will produce a 
design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.
What this means is, if you ask for teams to build a compiler, you're going to get a four pass 
compiler, you should not be surprised you got a four pass compiler, you asked four teams to build it. 
Likewise, if you have a UI team and an app team and a database team, they're going to build a three 
tier architecture. And you should not be surprised you got a three tier architecture, you asked three 
teams to build it. So how should these teams be organized, they should be aligned. You want them 
to be loosely coupled. You don't want a lot of dependency between teams, but you want the teams to 
be tightly aligned, because they are building a single application.
And then each team has its own mission, which should be aligned with the business.
If I was developing an e commerce application, and I had 50 developers, I wouldn't put them on one
big team like I did when I built monoliths. What I would do is I would break them up into smaller
teams an order team, an accounts team, a shopkart. team, a recommendation team, right, and they 
would have ownership of that business area. And then the team should have end-to-end 
responsibility.
You want them to build it, run it and debug it in production. You want that team to be responsible
end-to-end for what they're building. And then finally, they need to have a long term mission.
It really doesn't work well when you're pulling people on and off projects, because they don't feel a 
sense of ownership, so while long term mission is critical to business success. Autonomy is 
critically important. It's motivating, and motivated people build better stuff, it's just afact. It's fast. 
Decisions happen locally on the team level, rather than waiting for decisions to come down from on 
high. You know, this is what really holds people up. And so by minimizing these handoffs and 
waiting around, the teams don't get bogged down, they get to make their own decisions, and they 
get to run at their own speed. This graphic, the wall of confusion, was made famous by Andrew 
Clay Schafer, but it's all about the diametrically opposed metrics that we use with development and 
operations. Development wants change, right? They are measured on getting new changes out into 
production, whereas operations, they're measured on stability, how do you make the system stable, 
don't change anything.
These are diametrically opposed views. And if you hold these views in your organization, it doesn't
matter how agile you are, you're not going to get the benefits that you think you're going to get.


Now, I didn't draw this graphic, but I was on a project just like this. We were being agile. We
started out in January, and we were working in sprints, and finally in the middle of February,
we had something we wanted to deploy. And so we went to the operations team and they said,
"Open a ticket." We figured okay, we'll open a ticket, we'll get it deployed in a week or so.
And the ticket stayed later and later and later, and we waited and we develop more functionality
and still getting didn't get deployed. Well, finally the application got deployed in September,
and I left the project in December. I couldn't take it anymore. The moral here is of the entire
organization doesn't become Agile. It doesn't matter that your development team is agile. If
your ops team is not, this is what DevOps is all about. And you really should look into adopting
DevOps, if you want to take full advantage of becoming Agile. Otherwise, they're just going
to wait and wait and wait for the ops team to catch up to the Agile development team. Let's
look at the alignment of Agile and DevOps. One of the goals of Agile is to deliver software faster.
While DevOps goal is accelerating time to market perfectly aligned. In Agile, we want to be
responsive to change. In a DevOps, we're trying to tightly align the IT organization with the
business to to produce business value. In Agile, we're looking at attaining higher quality and in
DevOps, we're trying to increase the productivity of it. Those two goals are in alignment.
And so quite often, if you really want to get the full benefit of being Agile, you should look into
adopting DevOps as a practice as well, so that the ops team is just as agile as the development team.

In this video, you learn that how you're organized can affect the systems that you build.
Giving teams autonomy leads to motivated teams who can execute faster and build better systems.
Not adopting Agile across your organization can lead to operational bottlenecks and Agile and 
DevOps are closely aligned goals.

Mistaking Iterative Development for Agile


After watching this video, you'll be able to discuss how Agile is more than just iterative
development and describe what Agile is not. I want to introduce you to a pitfall that a
lot of organizations fall into. They claim that they're Agile, and then they start a new project.
And so they've got this studying and approval going on this design and planning. We call this
the fuzzy front end, right? They're kind of doing waterfall stuff, they're building requirements,
they're doing a lot of planning a lot of upfront stuff, it doesn't really seem Agile, then they
get it doing the actual development. And there, they're being iterative. So they're iterating on
the plan, iterating, iterating, iterating. The problem is, they're just iterating. They're not
being Agile, they're not stopping at the end of each iteration, to get feedback from the
customer, because they haven't deployed anything, they have no way of getting feedback from a
customer. They're not stopping at the end of every iteration and saying, "Should I pivot or 
persevere?"
They're just following a plan iterating, iterating, iterating, following the plan. And then finally,
there's what we call the last mile. Where they're trying to deploy it, and it takes forever
to deploy because nobody's ever deployed it before. This is the first time everything's been
integrated together. Right. And the operations team is trying to get it all working. And it takes
a long, long time. People think they're a Agile. They think they're working Agile simply because
they're iterating. But we like to call this Water- Scrum- Fall. They're just doing Waterfall with
they think they're doing Scrum in the middle. They're not really doing Scrum in the middle.
They're just doing iterative development. And so this is a pitfall a lot of companies fall into,
and it's really not being Agile. If a company is doing all this planning upfront,
they're not being Agile, they're not going to be responsive to change, they're not going to
be getting fast feedback unless they're deploying quickly. So this is a pitfall you want to avoid.

























So let's talk about what Agile is not. Agile is not just an iterative software development
lifecycle, like a mini Waterfall, the if you're going to do Waterfall tactics and plan everything
out, you're not going to be Agile. Agile is not just developers working in sprints, right? The 
development team and Agile are developers and testers and business analysts and maybe ops people 
if you're doing DevOps, right. It's a cross functional team, it's not just software engineers. And the 
Agile Manifesto has no mention of an Agile project manager, right? So there are no Agile project 
managers. If you've got a project manager who's doing command and control, you're not being 
Agile.
In this video, you learned that many companies adhere to their Waterfall planning, and just call it 
Agile. simply doing iterative development is not Agile,
unless you're being responsive to change and delivering value often. Project management is very
different when working as an Agile team because self managed teams assign work to themselves.

•	Simply doing iterative development is not Agile unless you are being responsive to changes 
and delivering value often

Destination Unknown
After watching this video, you'll be able to articulate why upfront planning leads to missed
deadlines and summarize why iterative planning leads to greater accuracy.
Douglas Adams famously once said, "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing sound they make as 
they fly by. Whoosh! There goes another deadline." This happens to us all the time, we put a
stake in the ground, and we miss it. The question is, why does this happen? But more importantly,
what can we do to avoid it? I like to call this navigating the unknown, right? So if I told you that 
you need to navigate across this field of penguins, you know, you might look down at the bottom 
there and say, "Well, I can I can kind of put my foot here and and maybe step in and step around." 
But then when you get to the middle, like how do you plot a course to the other side? Oh, and by 
the way, the penguins are going to keep moving as you're moving through them a lot like software 
development, where the operating system is getting patched and patched. And packages are getting 
patched. And you know, things keep moving, moving, but you know that as you kind of tiptoe into 
the middle of those penguins and you look down, it's going to look a lot like it did at the beginning, 
when you, because you know more, you're at a different vantage point.
And that's the whole idea, right, from this vantage point, you can probably continue to plot along.
And as you get closer, you'll have the next vantage point where you can plot along. So the message 
here is don't decide everything at the point you know the least. We do this all the time.
At the beginning of project, we know practically nothing, we know very little about the project.
And that's when we do all of our planning, right, as if we can figure out what's going to happen
towards the end. So stop doing that, right? That's what Agile is all about, iterative planning. Don't
decide everything in the beginning, when you know the least. what you want to do is just plan for
what you know and then as you move along, right, you decide you know more you adjust the plan.
So your estimates are going to be more accurate this way. Because you know, if somebody asks you
what are you gonna be doing three months from now? Tell them, "Well, I can tell you that we may
be 50% accuracy, right? But I can tell you with almost 100% accuracy, what I'm going to do two
weeks from now, right and two weeks after that." So the idea here is don't try to be omnipotent,
because you're not right. Don't try to plan everything up front. You want to plan as you go and as 
you learn more than you could add more to the plan and get greater and greater estimates at where 
you are and how long it's going to take for you to get there.

In this video, you learned that planning everything at the beginning of the project can lead to missed 
deadlines, and iterative planning allows for course corrections and more accurate estimates.

Agile Roles and the Need for Training

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe why placing existing people in new roles 
without training will lead to failure. So I'd like to discuss some organizational things that people do 
when they're trying to become agile, that do lead to failure, and one is placing people in a new role 
without giving them training. So the product manager becomes the product owner. There's a big 
difference here, the product manager is a job title. The product owner is a scrum role. They may be 
the same person, they may not be the same person. Then I see the project manager becoming the 
scrum master with no training on how to be a scrum master. And finally, the development team 
becomes a scrum team. But they're just software engineers. There's no testers on the team. There's 
no ops people on the team. There's no business analysts or anything on the team. So let's look a little 
deeper into why doing these things leads to failure.
First, there's the product manager becoming the product owner. The product manager is usually 
a business person who manages the budget, they may or may not have a vision for how things are 
going.
But the product owner is the visionary who leads the team in a series of experiments designed to 
achieve whatever the sprint goal is. And these are not often the same sets of skills, you need to be 
more focused on where to take the product, then how to manage the budget. And also, the product 
managers usually the person, they're focused on operational aspects of the business, Right? Instead 
of being a conduit between the stakeholders and the team, translating those business requirements 
into the technical goals that the team needs to achieve.
So just be careful. Some project product managers are good at being product owners, some of them
are not just understand why one of them is a job title. The other one is a role in scrum, and it
may not be the same person.
The next thing is the project manager becoming the scrum master. It's key to understand how 
project managers work. Our project manager is a task manager, they keep everyone marching to a 
plan. You know, when I teach Agile, quite often I'll get someone in the back of the room who's 
watching me do our sprint planning and creating our Kanban board and they'll say, "Excuse me, 
how do I know when I've assigned too much work to somebody?" And the answer is, you
don't assign work to anyone. That's why there's no way to tell, right? They're a self managing
team they assign work to themselves. So it's a very different job role being a scrum master, where 
you're a coach that keeps the team focused on the current sprint on being self managed.
The other big difference between a project manager and a scrum master is that when the project
manager feels that you have an impediment, they document the risk in their little spreadsheet, right? 
This is what they do, they document risks. And so if I've got a problem, I've got some blockage, the 
project manager is gonna say, "What are you going to do to unblock yourself." As opposed
to a scrum master that eliminates impediments while buffering the team from interruptions.
And so if the team says, "I have an impediment," the scrum master should say, "Let me handle that 
for you, you go work on something more productive. And let me get that out of your way." Project 
managers will almost never say that. So it really takes a different kind of person to take the role of
scrum master than the way project managers were taught to manage projects to a plan and document
risks.
And finally, it's the development team versus the scrum team. I mean, a development team
is usually just software engineers, right? Just developers. But a scrum team is a cross functional
team. It includes developers and testers and security people and business analysts and ops,
anybody that we need to go build an increment. So it's very important that you reorganize,
and you create cross functional development teams, not just a group of software engineers.
This is my favourite quote from Bill Cantor, "Until and unless business leaders accept the idea
that they are no longer managing project with fixed functions, timeframes, and costs as they
did with Waterfall, they will struggle to use Agile as it was designed to be used."
So the roles have changed. You can't put people in a new role without giving them training,
right. Otherwise, a project manager will try as hard as they might to turn a combine board
into a Gantt chart, because that's all they know, is managing projects with Gantt charts.
Very important that this mindset has to come down from upper management, upper management 
cannot be asking you to predict things way far into the future. Instead of asking what are you going
to get done by the end of the year they should be saying what are you going to do in the next two 
weeks? How are you going to delight my customers at the end of the next sprint?

In this video, you learn that placing existing people in new roles without the proper training will 
lead to failure because Agile roles need a different focus and new priorities.
The Agile mindset must be adopted by management.

Kanban and Agile Planning Tools

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe what a Kanban board is,
explain what each pipeline is used for, and summarize the workflow across a Kanban board.
So there are lots of Agile planning tools out there. But one thing you need to understand is that a 
tool won't make you agile, you really have to have the Agile mindset to become agile.
Tools will support your Agile process, but you have to have the process first. I've seen a lot of 
people who haven't had training try to make a Kanban board look like a Gantt chart.
Those are two different things, two different ways of doing project management. So it's really 
important that you understand this. And there are lots and lots and lots of Agile planning tools.
Most of them do the same thing, but some of them are a little more complicated than others.
I just need epics and stories to describe my plans. Some of them go into tasks and subtasks.
And I don't want, that's micromanaging in my estimation, right? Just epics and stories are fine. And 
so I like to use a tool called Zen hub. And we're going to use ZenHub for this course. So what is 
Zen Hub? Well, it's a plugin to GitHub. It's one of the reasons I like it.
My developers stay in GitHub and they use this Zen Hub plugin. What Zen Hub does is it allows 
you to add project management tools, a Kanban board, to manage your projects while you remain in 
GitHub.
So that's pretty important to me. The other is, is that Zen hub is customizable. It starts out with a set 
of columns, which are called pipelines, in your Kanban board, but you can customize them to be 
anything you like. You can make it as complex or as simple. I like to keep them simple.
So why do we use it? Well, one of the main reasons is because it uses GitHub issues.
It's not another tool with another thing that I have to go off and edit. That's one of the problems I 
find is if you're using too many tools, and a developer has to go someplace else to update the status, 
that status is going to be out of date 100% of the time. Because as soon as they updated, they're 
going to go on and do something else, and it's not going to be reflected in the status. So that's the 
reason I like ZenHub. It provides an easy way to understand what is going on. I've got my Kanban 
board in GitHub. And if anybody asked me, "How's the project going? Management wants to know 
where are you?" They can open up the ZenHub Kanban board, they can see all the issues that are
still in sprint, haven't been worked on. All the issues that are currently being worked on, and who's 
working on them, and all of the issues that we already have done. So very, very important to get a 
quick status of where we are in a project. And, as I said, it maintains an up-to-date, one version of 
the truth, developers work on stories and GitHub all day long. The issues in GitHub, which ar
stories. Those issues are the things that they open and close, and they don't have to go someplace 
else to update the status. The status is kept right in their favorite tool, GitHub. So it allows 
developers to go one place to get things done, and not have to update multiple tools.
So what is a Kanban board? We've been talking about Kanban boards here. Very simply put, there's 
things that you need to do, things that you're doing, and things that you've already gotten done. It 
doesn't have to be any more complicated than that. People make it very, very complicated. But it's 
kind of you know, what I got to get done, what am I working on now, and what have I already done. 
And you move things across the Kanban board, in order to show the progress that you're making, so 
it's a very visual way of seeing exactly where you are at any point in time. Now, here's a real 
Kanban board. And as you could see, it's got the product backlog.
And it's got what's on deck and it's got what's doing and what we have done.
So it's kept it very simple, but this is a real Kanban board. It's not a tool. It's not some electronic 
thing. It's a physical whiteboard with a bunch of sticky notes. So in true Kanban fashion of having a 
billboard note, a note that moves along the supply chain moves along the management, the 
manufacturing chain, that's what they do. You take a sticky note, and you write the story on it. And 
then you move the sticky note across the whiteboard across those columns. I mean, that's as simple 
as a Kanban board needs to be.























So let's talk about the default pipelines or columns that are in ZenHub. It starts with new issues. 
New issues is like your inbox. When anybody opens up an issue. It defaults to going into the new 
issues column. And so I don't like to leave it there too long. When I when I do my backlog 
refinement and I work on my Kanban board, I usually do new issue triage first and say this is 
something that just came in, where should it go? And I move it to another pipeline, or I reject it, but 
I don't keep it in the new issue so that when another one comes in, I know, oh, that must be really 
new because I just cleaned that out kind of like your inbox for emails.
Then there's the icebox. This is unique to ZenHub, but I kind of like it.
The icebox is cold storage. It is where you put things that are going to be, you're going to work
on long term. So if I'm not going to get to something for a while, I'll throw it in the icebox. So I 
don't forget about it. But then it is not in my other pipelines that I'm actively working on so that they 
don't get too cluttered up. After the icebox is the product backlog. The product backlog is	 
everything you ever want to do forever in your product that you haven't done yet.
Right. It doesn't contain things you're doing. It contains all the things you haven't put in
a sprint that you want to work out at some time in the future. And again, in order to keep that 
product backlog not too cluttered things that are long term future, I like to move into the icebox.
That brings us to the sprint backlog. The sprint backlog is what we're going to do in the next two
weeks. So I've taken things from the product backlog and move them to the sprint backlog to make 
a sprint plan. Now the developers don't have to worry about any of these other pipelines, they just 
concentrate on the sprint backlog, because that is the work we're going to do in the next sprint. Then 
once we start working on things we move them to in-progress. So I know that when I see those 
cards, those stories in the in progress column, I know that somebody is working on them as they 
assign them to themselves, their little avatar shows up. So I can see exactly who is working on what 
and what is being worked on as we speak. Once the work is complete, then a
developer usually create a pull request to go pull their work back into the base branch. And so those
go into review QA, you can also set up GitHub and ZenHub so that it automatically creates pull
requests in that review QA column. And so that so that developers know, when they see something
show up there, that they need to go look at it and help another developer out and review their story
and make sure that they get, it meets the criteria needed to go merge it into the rest of the code.
And then finally, there's the done column. After we're all done, we've merged our code back, then 
we move the story to the done column. So done means the developer is done. It doesn't mean that
it's been accepted by the product owner. That is something that happens during the sprint review.
But it does mean that the developer is done with that story. They go back to the sprint backlog,
pulling the story into in-progress, assign it to themselves and keep working. So the flow goes from
left to right. New stories come in on the left and a done increment winds up going out on the right.

In this video, you learn that a Kanban board is a way of tracking planned items needed to be done,
items in progress, and items completed. A Kanban board is made of multiple pipelines.
Work moves from left to right as it is completed.

Planning to be Agile
Users Stories
Creating Good User Stories

After watching this video, you'll be able to define a user story, describe the parts of a good user 
story, explain why adding acceptance criteria is important, define the invest acronym, and describe 
an Epic and when to use it. So what is a user story? Simply put, the user story represents a piece of 
business value that the team can deliver within a done increment. We used to call these 
requirements, but user stories are so much more. Requirement is usually, I need this, I need that, but 
a user story includes: Who is it for? What do they need? But very importantly, why do they need it? 
What is the business value that they get out of getting this feature or function?
So stories should contain a good description of the business value:
What it is. Who needs it? What is the value that we get out of that story?
Then, I like to have any assumptions, and any details documented in the story. Sometimes, you 
know there are assumptions, you're doing a story and it needs some kind of persistence.
And you know you're going to use a relational database, put that in there to give the developer a 
hint, "Hey, don't go looking for NoSQL databases, we decided we're going to use a relational 
database. So anything you know, any assumptions, we're going to provision something in the cloud,
put that in the user story, so that the developer knows what your intentions are.
And then most important, you need the definition of done, some acceptance criteria. How do I know
when this story is complete? When it is done? You don't want to find out in the sprint review that 
the the product owner says, "Hey, that's not what I wanted." You want to document the definition of
done to say, "Well, this is the definition we agreed on. This is what the story does, and if it's not 
what you want, we can write another story, but we did what they said it should do."
So the story description, what do you put in that description? Again, you want to document a 
persona, requesting some functionality to get some goal or achieve some goal, get some business 
value. And so the way that we do this is with this problem in syntax as a role. What's the role? Is it 
the marketing manager? Is it the customers? The sysadmin? Right? Who is this for? And then I need 
some functionality. What is it that they need? This is the meat of the user story, but very 
importantly, so that I gain some business benefit. What is the benefit of delivering that function?
When we go back and we prioritize the backlog, we're going to look at the business value as one of 
the criteria to say, "Should this be high in the backlog or lower in the backlog?" So it's very, very 
important, not only to have what it is, but what's the value that we get out of it?
Then there's assumptions and detail. So anything that you know, right, it doesn't have to be in great 
detail. But anything you know, as I said, you know, if you know that you're going to use a database, 
some persistence, you know, just list it there. Anything you talked about while you're writing the 
story, put that in. What you're trying to do is help the developer understand what needs to be done; 
anything that wasn't obvious to get this story completed. And then there's the acceptance criteria, the 
definition of done. This is critically, critically important. Really important to understand what 
makes this user story finished, complete or done. And for that we use a syntax called Gherkin, 
named after the pickle. And Gherkin is a syntax that makes it easy for stakeholders, customers, and 
developers alike to describe the definition of done. To describe the behavior of the system. And it 
goes something like this. Given some precondition, this sets up the story, given I have five items in 
my shopping cart, right? Given I'm already logged into the system, given whatever the given is, it 
sets up the story. And then what's the action that happens? Right? What is the thing that triggers it, 
when this happens, when I add another item to my cart, or I delete an item to my cart? And then 
finally, what is the testable result of that?
Then I should see this, I shouldn't see that, I should have six items in my cart, or I should see four 
items in my cart, right? It makes it very easy for everyone to understand.
Given this is the is the base case, when this happens, then I should have some measurable outcome. 
And if I measure that outcome, the story is done. So let's look at a sample story.
As a marketing manager, now we know the role. This is not for the customer. This is not for the
sysadmin. This is for the marketing manager, so we know who is going to gain some benefit from 
this.
I need a list of customer names and emails. So now we know what the function is, they need to list 
out customers with their emails, and then the business value, so that I can notify them of marketing 
promotions. But now I can say, "How important is it to notify customers of marketing promotions?" 
And maybe I put that before another story that is less important. So now I've captured: Who is it 
for? What is it that I need? And why do I need it? What value do I get from it?
Then I like to put in any assumptions. These assumptions help the developer
in creating the code that goes with the story. So one assumption is we maintain customer emails, 
maybe we don't. Maybe this story has a dependency on another story that actually creates the 
customer emails. Maybe there's another assumption: Customers have opted in to promotions. That's 
kind of important. Somebody might not have thought of that. Hey, we can't just email all our 
customers, we have to allow them to opt into getting promotions.
And then we have the acceptance criteria. What is the definition of done? What is the behavior
that we want this story to have? And we'll use that Gherkin syntax, given there are 100 customers
in the database. So that sets up the scenario. And 90 have opted into email promotions. So this is 
critically important is not just all 100, it's the 100 that have opted in to email promotion, so now 
developers know they need to filter how many customers in the database by who has opted in.
When I request a customer email list, so that is the action, that is the thing that happens, then I 
should see a list of 90 customer emails, not 100 customer emails, 90 customer emails, because only 
90 opted in to the email promotion. So you can see that this is something you could give to a 
stakeholder, the marketing manager could understand the behavior and say, "Yep, that is the 
behavior I want." The developer can read this and say, "Yep, that's the behavior I can deliver."
And that at the end of the sprint, as long as when you ask for customers,
you only get the ones who have opted in. And that is the definition of done. And so there's
no arguments about whether the story is done or not. If it has that behavior, it's done.
I'm not much for acronyms, but Bill Wake has a pretty good one with INVEST. INVEST says, 
"Stories should be independent, I want to be able to rank them in the backlog, I want to be able to
move them around, I want to be able to say that this one comes before that one." Now I know they
can't always be independent, sometimes there are dependencies, right? In the previous example,
we had an assumption that there were customer emails in the database, and if there weren't, then
that wasn't an independent story, it was dependent on the story that put emails in the database. But
for the most part, you want to try to write them so that they're independent. They also need to be 
negotiable, right? I'm going to move them in the backlog. I'm going to rank them higher or lower. 
Maybe I'm going to say we should put more value more functionality or less functionality to 
negotiate how much really has to be done. So they should be negotiable. They shouldn't be too 
tightly coupled to exactly what's needed. And then they need to be valuable, right? I need to be able
to say, "How valuable is this story? What is what value does the customer get out of it, to make sure 
that it really is a user story." And and not just a technical debt story that this is something I need to 
do that the customer never sees. It needs to be estimable, I need to be able to estimate it. How big is 
it? Small? Medium? Large? There has to be enough information in there that I could say, "Wow, this 
is a really big story, given everything that's in here." Alright. And it's not just one line that looks 
simple, but then really becomes hard. And it should be small. You want it to be something that 
someone can work on in a sprint, so it's got to be smaller than a sprint. And then finally, it needs to 
be testable. I need to be able to test whether that story is done. I want to test the definition of done 
for that story. And so stories need to be testable. What about really big ideas? Well, really big ideas 
are called Epics.
We use epics anytime that we have a story that is bigger than a single sprint, because the story
must be smaller than a sprint, by definition. And so when it's bigger, that becomes a big idea that
we can't get done in a sprint, so we make it Epic and then we add smaller stories that make up the
Epic to the Epic. So an Epic in the hierarchy is higher than a story. Stories are consumed by Epics. 
And so usually any story that's too big, we make it Epic, right? If we can't estimate it on its own, 
then we break it down into smaller things that we can estimate. So when do we use an Epic?
Well, clearly, when a story is too large to put in a sprint, then we make it an Epic. Usually backlog 
items will start out as big ideas, right? They're they're gonna, they're gonna be very large. And so 
they start out as Epics. And then as we refine the backlog, we make them smaller and smaller stories 
that we can put in a sprint. And so for sprint planning, you want to break all of those big stories up 
into smaller stories, break up all those Epics into smaller stories,
Things that usually come in the new issues, sometimes those are Epics, right. Somebody asked for a 
feature or a function. It sounds pretty simple, but it's going to take more than one sprint. And so you 
put it in as an Epic, and then you break it down into user stories later.
In this video, you learned that a user story documents a persona requesting a function to achieve a 
goal. Using a template helps ensure stories are complete.
Defining done helps minimize misunderstandings and well formed stories will meet the criteria
of the INVEST acronym. And Epics can be used to capture big ideas.

Effectively using Story Points

After watching this video, you'll be able to define story points, describe
considerations for assigning story points, and estimate story points on a relative scale.
So what are story points? Story points are a metric used to estimate the difficulty it is to
deliver and implement a user story. The key thing is that this is an abstract measure. And that's
what people get hung up on, people have a hard time dealing with the abstractness of it. But it's
very, very important that you understand this so that you don't fall into one of the anti patterns.
So what goes into that estimate? Well, there's a couple of components. First, is the effort,
right? How hard is it to do? Then there might be the complexity, right? Is it very complex? Is
it very easy? You could have a lot of effort for something that's easy to do, but it's just boring
and laborious. And you have to go off and do it. It might not be very complex. But then there's
uncertainty. Have you ever done this before? Right, maybe if you've never done it before, you rate 
the story points a little bit higher, because there's more uncertainty, you really don't know how 
complex it is. So it's a trade off between what you know, and what you don't know.
So traditionally, humans are really really bad at estimating wall clock time. Remember, we love to 
see those dates go wooshing by, we commit to something and then we miss it, right. And then
we learn that the only thing that takes 30 minutes is 30 minutes, everything else takes longer.
So it's really really difficult for humans to say, this is going to take an hour, this is going to take, this 
is going to take a week. And so we don't do that. If we're not very accurate at predicting that way, 
let's not predict that way. So instead, we use t shirt sizes, story points are t shirt sizes. Is it a medium 
story, a small story, a large story, an extra large story. We just want to give a relative value of how 
big this thing is, so that we can just compare it with other things that are in the current sprint. But 
because we can't add up s m l and get a number. And we want to use numbers to track velocity, 
which is something the number of story points that we can do at a sprint. Most tools, we use a 
Fibonacci sequence. I never use all of the numbers in the sequence, what I recommend is five 
is a medium, and three is a small and eight is a large, maybe 13 is an extra large, and I don't go 
much beyond that, right? You can use the entire sequence, that's fine. But don't get too granular. 
Remember, humans are not really good at doing this kind of estimation. So we want to keep it 
abstract. So how do I make it abstract? Well, you have to agree what medium means, right? Since 
the story points are relative, you all agree on okay, this is medium. So we say mediums of five. And 
this is what a five story is. And then we could take the other stories and then we could say, evaluate 
from there. Is this one smaller than that story?
Is it larger than that story is the same size as that story. So here's how I learned story points.
If you're asked, "How tall are these buildings?" You might try to count the floors. Every floor is 
about 20-25 feet, little back of the napkin, but what if I said to you, "Hey, this story, this building is 
a five. How big is the building next to it, just to the left of it?" You say, "Well, that one's probably a 
three. If that one's a five, that one's a three? Well, how about the one to the right of it that's a little 
bit taller, maybe that one's an eight. And then maybe the largest one is a 13." It's just relative sizes, 
you're just saying if this story is medium, or this story is small, is the other story bigger? Is larger? 
And so that's how I learned to do and to kind of rationalize what are story points, it's just relative. 
They're all relative to something the team does.
So, what should be the size of a story? Well, the story should be small, relatively small, hopefully 
something I could do in a couple of days, right. You don't want to make them too big. You don't 
want to make them drag on and on and on. So you want to keep those stories small, and estimate 
things that are, that you can hopefully get done in just a few days, right? Large stories should be 
broken down into smaller ones. So if you have a story, you say, "This is a 21." And you decide,
"Wow, that is super duper extra large that isn't going to fit in a sprint, then that has to get broken 
down to smaller stories." And maybe some of it gets done this sprint some of it gets done next sprint 
and maybe we create an epic to track the fact that it's gonna take multiple Sprints.
Now let's talk about some anti patterns, because it's really important that you understand these.
The first anti-pattern is evaluating stories on wall clock time. I see this happen all the time, and it 
relates back to our organizational anti-patterns. So I get a Scrum master, who didn't start out as a 
Scrum master. They started out as a project manager, and they love their Gantt charts, and what's a 
Gantt chart? It's walk clock time it's dates on a calendar and so they can only think in dates on a 
calendar. And I have seen Scrum masters who are former project managers tell the team, "A one is 
one day, a three is three days, a five is five days..."
...or five hours or 12 hours or whatever. That is the ultimate wrong thing to do. It is not about
wall clock time, it is just relative size, right? So a medium might take me two to three days,
maybe sometimes four days, a small might take me a day less than a day.
You just agree on kind of a fuzziness about this. But never ever, ever, never tell your team that that 
thing of Fibonacci sequence those story points, they are days or they are weeks.
That, that is an anti pattern. Humans are really bad at estimating wall clock time. Just don't do it.

In this video, you learn that story points are a metric used to estimate difficulty of implementing a 
given user story. Story points or relative like t shirt sizes. You must agree on what average means. 
And you should never equate story points with wall clock time.

Building the Product Backlog

After watching this video, 	you'll be able to define a product backlog, describe how to assemble a 
product backlog, and convert requirements into stories.
So if we look back at the steps in the scrum process, in this module we're just going to concern 
ourselves with the product backlog.
How do we build a product backlog?
So what is a product backlog?
A product backlog is all the unimplemented stories, right? Stories that are not in a sprint, they're not 
being worked on, they're waiting to be worked on.
Usually we back, we rank this in ranked order. Now, if they've got a long product backlog, the ones 
at the top will be ranked a little more accurate than the ones down at the bottom and that's okay.
You only have to rank maybe the next sprint or two and then the rest of them could be relatively 
unranked but the top of the backlog should be ranked in order of business important.
What's the next most important thing that we need to get into a sprint? And then the stories at the 
top should have more detail than the stories at the bottom, right?
So as we work on this backlog and we work on the stories, we want to get the ones at the top sprint 
ready, having all the details they need and the ones at the bottom again, they're a little bit fuzzier.
We're going to work on them later, we'll add more details later. So, we're going to go through an 
example and in this example we're going to give you some sample requirements for the service that 
we're building. So, what are we building?
We're going to build a hit counter, we're going to be a service that counts things, so I could give the 
counter a name and then every time I increment it 1, 2, 3, 4, and then I say, "How many of those do 
I have?"
And it gives me back the number 4, so it's just a little counting service that we use to count things, 
hits to a page, count whatever you want.
So it's a counting service. Now, we want it to allow multiple counters eventually, so having multiple 
counters that we can count multiple things is one of the requirements that we have.
Also the counters need to persist across restarts. So this just can't be an in memory counter.
It's going to need some kind of persistence, some kind of database so that when the system restarts 
and comes back up it remembers all the counters.
And then we have a requirement that says, "You know, I probably need to be able to reset a counter 
once in a while back to zero."
So I could start counting those things again and so resetting a counter is another requirement that 
the customer has given us.
So if we look at the kanban board in ZenHub, you'll see these columns, they're called pipelines for 
new issues, icebox, product backlog, sprint backlog, in progress, Q&A, review Q&A and done. And 
so for this exercise we don't have to worry about anything but new issues.
Let's talk about creating new stories. We've got new issues and it's empty and so we're going to start 
creating the first story: Needed service for counting things.
So let's go back to our story template, remember as some role, I need some function, so that I 
gained some benefit.
Let's apply this to that first story, need a service for counting things, well, maybe this is for the user.
Right as a user, I need a service that has a counter so that I can keep track of how many times 
something has been done.
So now we know who it's for, what is it, and what is the value that they get after it and at this stage 
that's about all I know about the story.
And so I will put this story into the new issues, I'll create a new issue for this story and so now it 
turns into a regular story.
Let's look at the next requirement: Must allow multiple counters. Again, we go and look at "who is 
this for?"
Probably still for the user. As a user, I need to have multiple counters so that I can keep track of 
several counts at once.
Again, we know who it for, we know what they need, we know how valuable it is to them so as we 
rank the backlog, we could say, "How valuable is that they can keep track of several at once? 
Maybe in the beginning not, maybe let's just get one working," right?
So this is all the information you need to know in order to rank this backlog later on. So that 
becomes a story in new issues.
Let's look at the next requirement, persist counters across restarts, so who is this for?
Well, maybe this one's for the service provider, right?
Maybe the service provider would be embarrassed if the service gets rebooted and they lose all the 
counters.
So maybe this one's for the service provider, I need a service to persist the last known count so that 
users don't lose track of their counts after the service is restarted and we can evaluate how important 
that is.
That's our third story and now let's look at the 4th requirement: Counters can
be reset. So we go through it again, this one might be for a system administrator.
Maybe we say, "Hey, only the sys admin can reset a counter."
Maybe we don't let users reset the counters. So, I need the ability to reset the counter so that I can 
redo counting from the start.
The important part here is that you're saying who it's for. Specifying the role makes everyone clear 
who's going to benefit from this.
"I need," says what is it they really need and the, "so that" says, "What is the business value that 
they're going to get out of it?"
So now I've got my fourth story in the backlog. Now let's move on to prioritizing the backlog. Now 
that I've got them in new issues.
I want to decide should I put them in the icebox or should I put them in the product backlog?
What do I do with these?
Remember I said I like to use new issues as my inbox, so now that we got these four things in the 
inbox, let me go do something with them.
Let me prioritize that backlog.
So I'll take the first one and say, "You know what?
That's kind of fundamental." Right?
We need to get the service running, so that was going to go right to the top of the product backlog.
Then I look at the next one and I read it, right, I need to have multiple counters.
And I might say, "You know what? Multiple counters, we'll handle that later.
That's something we're going to do in the future, I'm not going to bite it off right now,." Then I look 
at I need the service to persist restarts.
I say, "It's probably something right after I get it working.
I probably want to put a database behind it."
So when I do my minimum viable product, it might not have any persistence behind it.
And then next it will have persistence. And then I look at the last one in the new issues as an 
administrator and say, "Yeah I might want to be able to reset the counter right after I persist it in the 
database.
So that I could start counting all over again. And so what I've done is I've taken these new 
requirements that came in from the customer which were just one liners and I wrote them in the 
story syntax.
I use the story template to say, "As a user I need, right, as some role 'I need' so that I get some value 
and then I move them into the backlog in some kind of priority order that I think I might want to 
execute them.

In this video you learned that a product backlog is a ranked list of all unimplemented stories.
Stories high ranked in the backlog should have more detail than those that are lower, and creating 
stories using the "As a, I need, So that" template to ensure everyone understands who it benefits and 
the business value it provides.

The Planning Process
Backlog Refinement: Getting Started



After watching this video, you'll be able to explain the process of backlog refinement,
describe how to run a backlog refinement meeting, and triage new issues on the kanban board.
So, if we go back to the steps in the scrum process, this time we're just looking at backlog 
refinement.
What do we do during the backlog refinement meeting?
We're ready to have our backlog refinement meeting and do backlog refinement.
So, this is the process of taking the backlog and ranking it, right?
You want to rank it in priority order so that the most important things are at the top of the backlog.
Then we break down larger stories into smaller ones.
We make sure that all the stories that are near the top are small enough to fit in a sprint.
Then, finally, we make sure the stories near the top have enough detail that a developer can just take 
them and start working on them once we put them in a sprint plan.
Now the backlog refinement meeting itself...
Who should attend?
Well, the product owner is the key person.
They're the person who should be writing the stories.
They don't always write the stories, but the product owner has the vision and the product owner 
should be creating stories that the team will work on.
So, they need to be there.
The scrum master is another person you would invite to the backlog refinement meeting because the 
scrum master is going to assist the product owner in refining that backlog.
Then the development team is optional.
I usually like to take maybe a development lead or architect and have them in there just to answer 
technical questions.
How hard is this?
Where should we rank this?
Sometimes it's not a business decision, there's the technical dependencies that you need to know.
I do not have the whole development team, the whole scrum team there.
That would be a waste, in my estimation, a waste of their time.
I just want to have one or two technical people to help out.
So, what's the goal?
Well, the goal is to have a ranked backlog, right?
The goal is to have this backlog, this product backlog, that's ranked in order of importance.
So, the thing at the top is the most important.
I know a lot of product owners have trouble with this.
Well, everything's important, they say.
Okay, but there can only be one 1 and one 2 and one 3.
So, what's the most important?
Put that one at the top, then the next important, the next important.
It really helps you kind of focus on your business goals and what's valuable to your business,
and then make sure that the story contains enough information so that developers can then take that 
story and put it into a sprint.
You don't want to be adding detail during the sprint planning meeting.
In the sprint planning meeting, which comes next, you're going to want to describe the stories and 
have the developers understand them, but you don't want to do a lot of typing in that meeting.
So, the more you can do in this backlog refinement meeting to make the story sprint ready, the 
better off you're going to be and the faster your planning is going to go.
So, if we look at our kanban board, we've cleared out the new issues, we've got one story in the 
icebox, three stories in the product backlog, so we don't have to worry about anything but those 
three columns for now.
We've got some things in the icebox and some things in the backlog but, wouldn't you know it, 
those pesky customers, they have been writing more issues.
It always happens.
So, they've added a couple of new ones since we had the last backlog refinement meeting, "need the 
ability to remove a counter," oops, we've got that one, right? and "deploy the service to a cloud," 
somebody wants to deploy to the cloud.
So, this happens all the time.
That's why it's called new issues.
New things are coming in, new requirements, and so one of the first things I like to do in my 
backlog refinement meeting is to deal with that.
I call this new issue triage.
What you want to do is start with the new issue column.
I know you want to refine that product backlog but constrain yourself, look at the new issue 
column.
You want to make that empty, right?
You want to make sure that at the end of the backlog meeting there's nothing in the new issue 
column because there might be something really important that ought to be done in the next sprint.
So, you kind of have to look at the new issues and understand:
Is there something that we might want to put right at the top of the backlog or not?
Or are there things that we'll put and we'll get to eventually?
Put them in the ice box.
It's really important.
The goal is to have that new issue column empty when I do new issue triage.
Remember, that's my inbox.
I want my inbox to be emptied out at every backlog refinement meeting.
So, what do we do?
We take the story, some new issues, and we decide:
Do we move them to the product backlog?
Is this something we're going to do maybe in the next sprint, a spring from now, two sprints from 
now? Depending on how deep your product backlog is, depending on what your criteria is, for 
putting something in the ice box as opposed to putting it in the product backlog.
If it's something I'm not going to work on for a while, then maybe I put it in the ice box and say, 
"You know, that's a great idea.
It's not our top priority. I'll put it in the ice box and we'll deal with it in a future sprint."
Or you might say, "You know, this isn't where this product is going."
I just reject it out of hand.
This is something we're never going to do.
It's not in our wheelhouse.
So, you reject it, but that's what you want to do with these new issues.
They're either going to the product backlog, [if] they're longer term you put them in the icebox or
they're just not something that you feel you want to take on, and then you reject them out of hand.
So, now let's do this.
We look at the first one "need the ability to move the counter."
I say, "You know, that's something that we might do eventually but we don't even have multiple 
counters yet."
I don't want to remove the one and only counter, so I move that one into the ice box.
Then I look at "deploy servers to the cloud" and say, "You know, maybe we should do that sooner 
rather than later. In fact, I want to do that before we have the ability to reset a counter. You know, 
once we get this deployed, and we get some persistence, let's go put it up in the cloud, right?"
So, now I've made a decision.
I've got that new one in the product backlog and I've got the other one in the icebox.
So, let's look at the workflow for backlog refinement.
The product owner is taking these stories and they're putting them in the backlog in order of 
importance, right?
Taking things that they thought weren't important that might become important and shift them 
around.
The items... we might provide estimates, at this point.
The reason why I would do estimates?
So, sometimes you save estimates until you do sprint planning because those are the real estimates 
of the plan but, you know, it's kind of nice to know how many story points are in my backlog.
Even if it's a gross estimation, you know a rough order of magnitude.
So, sometimes we will assign story points in the backlogs.
We kind of see how big is the backlog, how many story points are in there, and then when we put 
them in the plan.
We refine them.
We get the team to agree, was that really a medium?
Or they might say, you know, that's really a large but at least I get some estimate in there.
So, you might want to do that.
Then the large vague items, they have to get split up, right?
Vague items have to be clarified.
Large items have to be split up into smaller items.
The goal here is to make the stories, what I call sprint-ready.
They are ready to put in the sprint and I don't have to spend a lot of time during the sprint planning 
meeting adding any details.
Something may come up in the meeting where a developer might ask a question and you document 
that question in the assumptions, but for the most part from what we know now, at the backlog 
refinement meeting, I want to make sure these are sprint-ready.
So, let's use this complete story template.
We talked about the beginning of it.
As some role, I need some functions so that I get some business value.
But now we want to go back and we want to add acceptance criteria, anything we might know
and we want to add the definition of done using the Gherkin syntax.
When, you know, given some precondition when some event happens then I see some measurable 
outcome.
So, let's go do that.
So, let's take this first item on the product backlog at the top.
We look at it, it says as a user story I need a service that has a counter so I can keep track of how 
many times something was done.
You'll notice there's a couple of annotations on the side when you open up ZenHub. You see the 
webpage, it'll have that it's currently not assigned.
It has no labels.
It has no milestones.
It has no estimates.
That's how all the stories start out.
We're going to ignore those for the moment and we're going to embellish the story a little more.
So, what are some of the assumptions?
Well, the assumptions need a way to increment the counter.
So, maybe when we've got this counter, I have to be able to increment it and maybe
I want to do that in one step. Maybe I don't want to do a get,
and then a read, and then an increment, and then a put.
Maybe I just want to have an increment function that says, "Hey, in one atomic transaction,
increment that counter and I need a way to get the current value, right?
So, a way to increment it, a way to get the current value, I should be pretty good to go.
So, now I write my acceptance criteria.
Given I have incremented the counter to 2,
when I make a call to get the counter then it should return 2 is the counter value, right?
You can write a couple of these.
You can think of these scenarios that gives the developer the acceptance criteria that says, "This is 
the behavior we want the counter to have."
In the next video, we're going to take a look at how to add labels to our stories.

In this video, you learned that it's the product owner's responsibility to maintain a groomed backlog 
and you start refinement by triaging new issues.


Backlog Refinement Finishing Up
After watching this video, you'll be able to add details to make your story sprint-ready, identify 
stories that are technical debt, and rank your product backlog in preparation for sprint planning.
So, the next thing I want to talk about are the labels.
Labels help us visualize the work.
If we look at the kanban board over here, you see all these nice pretty colours.
Now, I don't get too crazy with the colours.
Too many colours, it becomes meaningless, but if I've got a couple of colours that catch my eye, 
then I can see, is there too much of that colour on my board?
And what does it mean to me?
So, let's look at these labels.
The labels come standard in GitHub, and these are the standard GitHub labels and colours.
You can see I've got bugs, bugs are red.
I like that.
Red means danger.
You don't want a lot of bugs.
Enhancements are the cyan colour.
Not bad.
Help wanted is in green.
So, these are kind of good.
I've got questions, won't fix, things that are invalid, and they help me visualize things about each 
one of the stories.
But I like to add 1 label that, surprising to me is not here, and that is technical debt down at the 
bottom, and I make that technical debt, I make it yellow because yellow means caution.
You don't want to have too much technique debt.
So, let's go back to my story and I look at it and say, you know what?
This is really adding value to the customer.
This is the first thing we're doing that's adding value, and I think it's an enhancement.
So, I'm going to assign the label of enhancement to this story, and then I'll save it.
When I save it, I go back to my product backlog and notice its appearance has changed and it will 
change in ZenHub when you use the tool.
You notice there's a little circle that...
There's an area at the bottom of it with a circle.
That circle is going to have the story points in it, so that'll have a number pretty soon.
And then I've got their little enhancement label and it's this, you know, light blue or cyan coloured 
enhancement label.
So, now I could start seeing with colours how we're doing on the kanban board.
Let's go take the next one, the next highest priority in the product backlog, and let's
go groom that one.
So, this one is as a service provider.
I need the service to persist so that I don't lose track of the counter and so, what are some 
assumptions?
Well, maybe we decide, you know what, I think we're going to use a Redis database.
It's this nice MEM cache database.
You know, we really don't need a relational database to keep track of a counter.
Developers might not know that.
So, if you know it may be the architect or the lead developer said, "Hey, you know,
we ought to put in there, so whoever picks this up knows, we're just going to use Redis
and we're going to store the counter as a name value pair in a MEM cache database."
So, anything you know about it, there's always assumptions, document them in your stories
and then we have our acceptance criteria.
Given I've incremented the counter two and I restart the service, then the counter should
still return to, right?
So that proves that we actually have persistence behind this.
Now if I go think about the label, I might say, you know what, that's an enhancement, right?
This is, this is something.
It's better now because now you don't lose the counter.
So, I'm going to say that one is an enhancement.
So, now when I go back to my kanban board, you see that one has been modified and we'll go pick 
the next story "deploy service to the cloud."
And when we open that, it's like, oh, all we have is "deploy service to the cloud"
because that one came from the new issues.
So, while we used the template when we created our initial stories, customers, stakeholders.
They're going to create more stories.
They're going to wind up in new issues.
They're not going to have a lot of detail in them, so "deploy service to the cloud."
So, let's go work on this one and refine it.
So, as a service provider I need the service to be deployed to the cloud so that it can
scale capacity with user demand, right, just so I know how important that is.
And maybe we have some assumptions, we're going to put it in the IBM Cloud and maybe
deploy it as a Cloud Foundry app. you know, whatever you want, you're going to put it in 
Kubernetes and deploy it as a container. Give the developer some hints on how you want to deploy 
this to the cloud.
And then we've got our acceptance criteria.
Given I've deployed to the cloud and a customer goes to the URL, our service will be available,
right?
This is all about availability, so now what labels should we give to this one?
I'm going to say this one is technical debt because there's really no added value to the
customer.
Although you can argue that higher availability is customer value, but the customer kind of
expects high availability, right?
So, this is not an enhancement that the customer might recognize, but if they would feel free
to make an enhancement but for the sake of argument, I'm just going to make it technical debt.
So, that begs the question, what is technical debt?
Technical debt is anything you need to do where the customer doesn't perceive that as value, right?
It's not really adding a feature to the product, but it's something you have to do.
If you didn't do it, maybe everything will fall apart and so you might say it's an enhancement
because the customer does get value out of things not blowing up, but usually, it's anything
you have to do that the customer has not perceived as kind of a customer story where they're
getting value out of it.
Now, many people understand that, you know, technical debt builds up over time, and they think it's 
a bad thing, but sometimes it occurs naturally, right?
Sometimes there are vulnerabilities in the code that are external libraries that have to be patched and 
that was not your fault.
It was something totally out of your control, so it does build up over time and it's important to pay 
that debt down.
So, let's look at some examples of what technical debt is.
Maybe some code refactoring.
So, those are things where we took some shortcuts and now it's time to refactor the code and the 
customer doesn't see a benefit from refactoring, but the developers, because it's refactored, maybe 
they can add enhancements quicker.
So, you can always argue eventually they'll benefit, but you know, if you wouldn't put on your list 
of new features, "we refactor our code," it's probably technical debt.
Setting up and maintaining environments.
Customers don't care about that.
You need to test the environment.
Any kind of environment, technical debt.
It has to be done, but you know the customer doesn't get a benefit.
Changing technology like databases.
We decided to go from an SQL to an No SQL customer doesn't see that it's all behind the scenes.
It's kind of technical debt, you know, not a bad thing.
Maybe it's going to allow you to do things you couldn't do before, but when you do those things you 
couldn't do before, those are enhancements, but just swapping databases, technical debt.
As I said, if there are vulnerabilities in libraries, you've got to upgrade the libraries
you've got to retest the code, make sure nothing broke.
Technical debt.
So, it's really, really important that you don't shy away from technical debt.
Understand what it is, give it a label.
Make sure that you put a little bit of technical debt in every one of your sprint plans so that you 
bring it down, but by having this label you could see how many stories on the kanban board are 
yellow with technical debt, how many are blue with new enhancements...
So, now you can see I've got this nice yellow label that shows me some of the stories in my backlog 
are technical debt.
We look at the last one as a System Administrator and the ability to reset it a counter, so I could 
recount something.
So, now let's add some assumptions.
Maybe the technical lead said, "Hey, you know, we ought to tell the developer how to
put this URL because it might be a little tricky, we want it to be a post to counters with a counter 
name and then a slash reset and that will reset the counter because there's multiple ways you could 
probably reset the counter, right?"
You could update it with a zero.
You could do it a lot of ways, but maybe that one because you want to protect it and only have 
admins do it, you make it a separate endpoint that only admins get access to.
And then your acceptance criteria.
Given the counter has advanced to five, when I call reset on the service and I request the current 
counter, then I should see zero return from the service.
So, now we have a nice understanding of how should this thing behave.
We've agreed on the definition of done so that there's no questions about it when we get to the sprint 
review and they demonstrate this, and that's exactly what it does.
No one can argue that that is what it was supposed to do.
So, now we'll assign a label, and I would say that's an enhancement.
Being able to reset counters is a new feature, so I'm going to go with enhancement on that
one.
So, now back to our kanban board.
We've got our product backlog all refined and we've got labels so that we quickly see, hey, we've 
got three stories that are enhancements, one story that's technical debt.
I've got this nice visual indicator and it's okay the ones in the icebox, they're going to be later.
We will refine those later, but the ones at the top of the product backlog have these nice labels and 
then maybe we can put some story points to them when we do the sprint planning for this go 
around.
So, let's look at some backlog refinement tips.
You should be refining the backlog every sprint.
My sprints usually go from Monday to the following Friday and about the Wednesday before the
end of the sprint, I like to have a backlog refinement meeting.
So, every other week, I'm refining my backlog, getting it ready for the sprint plan that
I usually have on Monday mornings at the beginning of the sprint, right?
Because you do your sprint retrospective and your sprint review on a Friday, everyone is
exhausted, they go home and then I do the Sprint planning first thing Monday morning,
so I usually do this on a Wednesday.
Now, some people do it every week, and if you have a lot of requirements coming in,
you might want to do it every week.
But it's important that, at least once a sprint, you're refining this backlog to keep it healthy.
You want to have at least, I'd like to have two sprints worth of stories refined in the backlog, right,?
So, if by some miracle, right, they get done with all the stories in a sprint, they need to pull more 
things from the backlog, they could just pull them from the product backlog.
But mostly I want to make sure that I don't get cut short if something happens.
You know, I've got enough stories that are refined that maybe I can skip a refinement meeting one 
week because of some delays or whatever.
So, I'd like to have at least two sprints worth kind of refined in that product backlog.
And then the more time you spend refining these stories, the less time you're going to spend doing 
sprint planning.
So, if you can add story points, we'll do it in the sprint plan, but if you can't add some story points 
during the planning, the backlog refinement meeting, then that's fine
because it gives an idea of how big these stories are.
But the more you do, the more detail you add, you don't want to be typing up stories during
the sprint planning meeting.
It'll make that planning meeting take forever.
So, trust me on this one.
Get all that done during the backlog refinement meeting.

In this video, you learn that backlog refinement is used to order the product backlog and make
stories sprint-ready.
Technical debt is any story that does not add perceived value to the stakeholder, and the goal is to 
get the backlog ready for the Sprint planning meeting.

Sprint Planning

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe sprint planning,
explain why having a sprint goal is important, describe how to run a sprint planning meeting,
assign estimates and labels to stories, produce a sprint plan.
In the scrum process, we've looked at product backlog and backlog refinement,
and we're now doing a sprint planning meeting, which will hopefully produce a sprint backlog.
Sprint planning is the meeting in which you determine
what stories are going to be in the next sprint, how much
can we accomplish in the next two weeks. We do that by producing a sprint backlog.
So, the sprint planning meeting: Who should attend?
Well, that should be the product owner, the scrum master, and the development team.
We don't invite stakeholders or anybody like that to this meeting.
It is just the core team. The three roles in scrum:
The product owner, the scrum master, and the rest of the team.
When I say development team, I mean software engineers, testers, uh, operations folks.
If you're doing DevOps, uh, maybe business analysts.
So, whoever is on the team that is building the thing that you're delivering.
A cross-functional team, not just software engineers.
So, we have to talk about goals here. This is very, very important.
Each sprint should have a goal. For some reason, it's hard for some product
owners to say what the goal of a sprint is. They're thinking, I need the whole thing
done but they've got to think, what can I get done in the next two weeks?
And so, it's very important that the product owner articulate the goal.
And then, here are the stories in the product backlog that support the goal so that everybody
knows why they're doing the stories and how that story is going to help us achieve whatever goal it
is, whatever capability, whatever you want to add to the product that we're building.
And so, it's important for the whole team to understand this.
Sometimes you're in the middle of a sprint, um, you know, and you have
some questions about how to do something and you're like, okay, what was the goal?
You know, am I getting off on some tangent here, on some other path?
The goal was to deliver this capability. Let me make sure I don't over-code it,
over-engineer it. Let me make sure
I meet the goal of delivering whatever it is we decided to deliver to the customer.
So, the mechanics of sprint planning, what the development team is going to do, and, this is
a development team activity, they're going to take stories from the top of the product backlog
and they're going to move them into the sprint backlog, and they're going to do
this on and assign story points. If you haven't had story points,
if you do have story points from the backlog refinement, they will check to
make sure they agree with those story points because they probably didn't create them.
So, the development team decides how big a story is.
They're the ones that have to commit to it, right? So, they have to make sure
they're comfortable with the story points. Sometimes they do a little something called
planning poker, uh, where they all, you know, hold up, I think, it's a three, I think, it's a five,
and they talk about why they think it's small or medium, and then they all agree,
yep, that's a medium story, I get it. So, very important to agree on how big
these stories are and then they want to make sure that each story contains enough information so
that they can start working on it. You don't want to be asking
questions in the middle of a sprint. You want to be able to take the next
story off the backlog and know that everything in it is there that you need to start working.
And so, it's important that all the developers understand, all the testers, all, everybody on the
team understands what that story is about in case they're the one that pulls it off the backlog.
And then, finally, you stop adding stories when you hit the team's velocity.
So, this begs the question, what is team velocity? I've mentioned it a few times now, right?
Velocity is the number of story points that a team can execute in a single sprint, right?
So, you take all the story points in the sprint, and sprint, and that becomes the team's velocity.
This is critical because it's going to change over time as estimates get more accurate.
It will change as the team gets more, uh, competent at implementing stories.
It's going to change so the velocity could change over time.
Hopefully it will get better and better and better, but here's the key piece:
you cannot compare the velocity of two teams. Velocity is a personal thing.
Each team decides what's a medium, right?
And so, a medium for one team might be bigger than a medium for another team.
So, it's not fair to compare their velocity. Also, some team might say, hey, two is a medium,
one is a small, right? Three is a large.
Another team might say five is a medium, threes are small, eight is a large.
Well, obviously, the team that picks the bigger numbers is going to have the bigger velocity,
but they may actually be doing less work, so unless all the teams agree on what a medium
story is, and all the teams agree on what numbers to use, which they don't always do
because the teams are independent, you cannot compare the velocity of two teams.
Not fair unless everybody's using the same measurements.
So, one of the first things you want to do when you do sprint planning is create a milestone.
Now, in ZenHub, you can use a milestone, which is part of GitHub, but ZenHub has just
introduced something called sprints. And so, sprints act like the old
milestones and you can use either. I'm still using milestones because
I can still track them in other ways in GitHub. The sprints are unique to ZenHub but they have
some cool automation where you can move stories from sprint to sprint.
So, you might want to look into that, but right now, I have my teams creating milestones.
So, you create the milestone, and you give it a title.
I usually keep the title short because they show up in drop down lists, right?
So, sprint one, colon, you know, deployed to cloud... just something really short so we know
what... sometimes the numbers are relevant, but we just know that sprint is, uh, deployed to cloud.
And then we want to give it a description and the description should be the goal, right,
so that everybody understands what are we doing this sprint.
Look at the description of the milestone, that goal, that's what we're all here to do.
So, make sure that we adhere to that goal and then you give it a duration.
And I like to have my sprints be two weeks. Some teams can do one week, I think it's a
little short, but you really don't want to go three, four, five weeks too many
things can change. I like to keep two-week sprints.
It's a nice cadence that's easy for most teams to do.
So, let's look at the user interface for creating a new milestone.
So, one of the things we want to do is we want to give it a title.
So, I've called this sprint one colon single counter, right?
We just want to implement a single counter, that should tell you right
there the multiple counter store is not going to be in the sprint, right?
The sprint is just about the single counter and then in the description, I like to put the goal.
The goal is to get a single counter working and deploy to the cloud, right?
So, I've kind of stated this is what we're all running for.
We want to get it in the cloud, we want to get just a single counter working, right?
And this is what we're going to commit to our stakeholders.
And then I've got to give it some dates. A start date and an end date.
And so I might say, yep, I'm going to start on Monday the 7th,
and then the following Friday the 18th is when we're going to be done with this two-week sprint.
And so, now I'm all ready to create that milestone.
Just a title, a good description, that gives you the goal and the start and end dates,
so we'll create a milestone. So, now if we look at where
we left our Kanban board, we had some groomed stories in the product backlog.
Some ungroomed stories in the icebox, and we don't have to worry about anything but the product
backlog and the sprint backlog. The goal here is to build a sprint backlog from the product backlog. 
So, if we look at it, we've got our stories.
They don't have any story points, so we're going to have to assign them.
Notice at the top of the sprint backlog, it says zero story points.
The tool will track how many story points you have in each one of the pipelines, and so, that's going
to tell us when we reach our team velocity. So, let's look at the first story.
So, I open the first story and I want to assign it an estimate, so maybe we talk it over as a
team and the team says, this looks like a rather large story because it's, you know,
it's setting up the initial, you know, counter, the increment, and then getting the values,
there's a number of things in here. Maybe they say, "This is a large one.
We're going to make it an eight." And then we assign it to the sprint milestone of sprint one.
So, now we know that this is in the sprint, and it's got,
uh, an estimate, uh, and so we'll close that one. Now when it shows up in the product backlog,
it has an eight in the circle to show us that it's eight story points.
We still have our label and it's also been assigned to the sprint, so now we'll move
that one over into the sprint backlog and the sprint backlog now shows us you've got eight
story points in the sprint so far. So, let's look at the next one.
We open it up, we talk about it as a team. Is this big?
Is it small? Medium? Large? What is it?
Maybe the team decides, hey, this is a medium, right, we know how to do this.
This is something that we think is kind of a medium story, get it done in a couple of days,
less than a week, um, and so that becomes a medium story.
And so, the next thing we want to do is assign it to the sprint.
So, now we've got this story assigned to the sprint.
It's a medium story. We go back to our Kanban board, we see that the
story points have been assigned and we drag and drop that one over into the sprint backlog
and now we're at 13 story points. And we'll go look at the next story.
So, this is what you're doing during the sprint planning meeting, right?
You're looking at each one of these stories. You're talking about it.
This one's a technical debt story, we talk about it with the team, the team decides this one's also
a medium, we assign it to the sprint milestone and then we save it and that one shows up with all
decorations and we drag and we drop that one into, um, the sprint backlog.
And so, you continue to do this until you hit your velocity.
So, let's say the team's velocity is 18 story points, um, and so we stop at this point and say,
hey, we've got enough things in our sprint plan, we don't want to over-commit.
The past has shown us that we can do about 18 story points, and that's the
beauty of story points, it's not wall clock time. It's like, you know, we could do a couple smalls,
a medium, maybe a large, or maybe, two mediums and a large, right?
It's not the number of stories... every sprint... it's given the estimates and given our past
track record of implementing 18 story points or 20 story points per sprint, we don't want to exceed
that commitment in the next sprint.

In this video, you learned that it is the product owner's responsibility to present the sprint goal, it is 
the development team's responsibility to create a sprint plan, and a sprint plan is created by moving 
stories from the product backlog into the sprint backlog until the team's velocity is reached.

Executing the Plan
Workflow for Daily Plan Execution

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe the daily workflow, determine which
story you should work on next, and explain why you should not work on more than one story at a 
time.
In the steps in the scrum process, we've gone all the way through backlog refinement and
sprint backlog, and now we are off to actually executing the sprint.
So, the sprint is one iteration through design, code, test, deploy, right? It's one iteration through that 
whole cycle and we do this in two-week increments. And it's really important that every one of 
them has a goal so everyone knows the goal that they're working for.
So, the daily execution, what each member wants to do is, when they start the sprint, they take the 
next highest item off the sprint backlog that they have the skills to work for.
I realize that some UI developers can't do backend work, that's fine, but the next item, the highest 
item, you don't get to pick one in the middle, you don't get to pick your favorite item, you should be 
doing in the order of business importance.
The next highest thing in the sprint backlog, you pull it off and you assign it to yourself.
Very, very important to assign it to yourself so everybody knows you're working on it.
And then you move it into In Progress so that now, visually, everybody can see that you're working 
on it. So, let's go back to our Kanban board.
We see we have three stories in the sprint backlog and so, right now, we don't care about anything
that is to the left of the sprint backlog because we want to concentrate on the sprint backlog.
What's in process? What needs to be reviewed? And what is going to get done?
So, right now, for your daily execution, you're going to take the next highest thing on the sprint 
backlog, move it to In Process and open it up so that you can assign it to yourself.
So, once it opens up, you click on the assignees. One of the cool things is that you can just click on 
a link that says Assign Yourself, otherwise, you could drop down and assign it to someone else.
But you want to go assign it to whoever you are in GitHub.
So, now I've just assigned this to myself and GitHub, uh, so I can close that story or, obviously, I'm 
going to read the story, understand what it is, understand what I have to do, and then go close that 
story, and then it shows up in the In Progress column with a little avatar.
It happens to be the avatar that is, you know, my picture on GitHub, but it's whatever your avatar
is on GitHub, that's what it shows up. So, look at what I can see here.
Now anyone, right, management, anyone can go look at who's working on what.
Somebody else on my team, oh, look that Rofrano guy, he's got that one in process, so, um, I'm 
going to go pick the next one off the backlog, assign it to myself, and then go work on it.
So, some key things to keep in mind when you're doing your daily execution, nobody should be
working on more than one story at a time. That's another important feature of having those little 
avatars show up because if I see the same avatar, then somebody's working on multiple stories, and 
the problem is, I can't ship fifty percent of two things that are incomplete.
I can only ship a hundred percent of one thing that's completed.
So, I don't want people having their focus pulled too many ways.
I want them to work on one thing, deliver a feature, and then go work on the next feature, unless, of 
course, they're blocked. If they're blocked, then it's okay, while someone's unblocking you, like the 
scrum master is going to unblock you, you can start working on a new feature and then get back to 
the one that was blocked.
When you're finished, you then go create a pull request and you move that story into review QA.
And there's a way to set up pull requests on GitHub with ZenHub so that when you create
a pull request it will automatically create that pull request in Review QA.
And if you assign a story to that pull request, you sign a Git issue to that pull request,
it will pull the issue from In Process over to Review QA and link them together.
So, it's a nice way of keeping everything neat and tidy so everyone knows a pull request has
been made because now I see things in the Review QA column that I should
probably go off and maybe review for somebody. And then when the pull request is then merged, 
now you can take and drag that into the Done column. Once your code has been merged with the 
base branch, the master branch, or the main branch, you can then move that to the Done column 
because you're done. And then you start all over.
You go back to the sprint backlog, take the next highest thing off the sprint, assign it to yourself, 
start working on it.

In this video, you learned that you need to
keep the Kanban board updated so that everyone knows what you're working on, it's important to
always work on the story with the highest priority that you have the skills for, and working on more
than one story at a time may lead to neither story being finished at the end of the sprint.


The Daily Stand Up

After watching this video,
you'll be able to describe what happens in the daily stand-up meeting.
Discuss the importance of time boxing the meeting to 15 minutes.
Explain what to do with topics raised at the meeting.
And conduct a daily stand-up meeting.
In the steps in the scrum process we've gone all the way through to the daily scrum or the daily 
stand-up.
So now we're learning about the daily stand-up meeting, this should happen in the same place and 
time every day.
It's important that people know where is the meeting today, right, usually it's the same place and 
time every day.
And then sometimes it's called the daily scrum, I've heard it called both daily scrum, daily stand-up.
Maybe daily scrum, scrum is kind of the whole process, so I like using the term daily stand-up.
Each member briefly discusses what they're working on, right, they report on their work, and this is 
a meeting for each other, for the team to get up to date on who's working on what, is anybody stuck.
Now it's called a stand-up because you're supposed to stand up, nobody should be sitting down.
This is a 15 minute time box meeting, very, very critical that it only takes 15 minutes, one of the 
ways of ensuring that is to have everybody stand up, right.
Usually they'll stand in a circle and just go around and and discuss, so that's why it's called the 
stand-up meeting.
this is really critical, I've seen these devolve with the project.
It's not a status meeting, it's a meeting for all of the development team, right, the software engineers, 
the testers, anybody on the team to understand who's working on what, and what are we going to 
get done today, and can I help anybody, so 15 minutes, answer some simple questions.
And so who should attend?
Well the scrum master should attend, the scrum master is someone who is helping the team be 
Agile.
If you have an advanced team you might say they show up without the scrum master, but the scrum 
master is critical because if anyone's blocked I want the scrum master to unblock them so I always 
have the scrum master attend the daily stand-up.
And then of course the development team, right, everybody on the scrum team attends the stand-
up.
Now the product owner is optional, I've had product owners show up some days, not show up 
others.
If they do show up they are not to speak unless spoken to, this is not a status meeting for the 
product owner, this is really, really critical.
And I see how these things devolve, right, into daily status meetings, it's not a status meeting.
So the product owner can show up, if they can be helpful in answering a question fine, they don't 
get to ask questions, they don't get to drill the team, that is not what this meeting is for.
They can have their own status meeting if they want to do that, that's not what the stand-up is for, 
the stand-up is for the development team, product owner is optional.
So what are these questions that everyone asks?
So each member answers these three questions in turn.
What did I get done yesterday?
What am I going to work on today?
And are there any blockers, are there any impediments in my way?
So everyone knows what I've been working on, I worked on something yesterday,
I plan to continue it today,
I might get finished tomorrow, I'm going to plan to continue today.
Or I worked on this yesterday, I'm going to pick up a new story today,
nothing is blocking me or something is blocking me.
Very, very important, impediments and blockers, if one of the team members is being blocked the 
scrum master has nothing more important than to unblock them, right, critically important that you 
keep the team moving forward.
And so that's why the scrum master needs to be at this meeting, so that if anybody is blocked they 
can go deal with it while they do some productive, like the team members, do more productive 
work taking another story off the backlog.
Yeah, so developers who are blocked take the next story off the backlog and start working on it 
while you're blocked.
Unless you're going to get unblocked in an hour or two then maybe go work on some other work, 
but if the blocker is going to be around for a while, start working on the next story.
So, let's talk about tabled topics.
And this is why I see these meetings running over the 15 minute time box, anything that comes up 
that is not part of the three questions should be tabled, right, and sometimes we say we put that in 
the parking lot.
So it's very, very important that the scrum master write it down so we don't forget we don't want to 
lose track of it, we're not trying to be rude, but we want to get through this meeting in 15 minutes 
reporting on those three questions.
And then if anybody is interested in the tabled topics we then do those after the meeting.
So I'll have the 15 minute scrum meeting and then say okay, the following topics came up, anybody 
who is interested in discussing them please stay, everybody else go have a productive day.
And then you can talk about those topics, maybe somebody needed help and someone else says, "I 
know how to do that I can tell you how." Tell them after the meeting.

In this video, you learned that the daily stand-up occurs every day for 15 minutes.
Each person should be prepared to answer the three stand-up questions.
The daily stand-up is not a status meeting.
Topics not related to the stand-up should be addressed after the meeting.

Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
•	You need to keep the kanban board updated so that everyone knows what you are working 
on
•	It is important to always work on the story with the highest priority that you have skills for
•	Working on more than one story at a time may lead to neither story being finished at the end 
of the sprint
•	The daily stand-up occurs every day for 15 minutes
•	Topics not related to the stand-up should be addressed after the meeting
•	Each person should be prepared to answer the three stand-up questions:
- What did I accomplish the previous day?
- What will I work on today?
- What blockers or impediments are in my way?

Completing the Sprint
Using Burndown Charts
After watching this video, you'll be able to define a burndown chart, describe how to read a 
burndown chart, and explain how burndown charts can help forecast the team's ability to achieve 
the sprint goal.
So, a burndown chart is one of my favorite charts. It's a tool that I use a lot because it lets me
quickly and easily see, is the team going to reach their sprint goal?
It works off of milestones, although now with the new ZenHub, it also works off of sprints, but a 
milestone could be anything, right? A milestone could be a demo that you're going to do or you're 
going to go to a conference and the milestone is to get the code ready.
But usually, milestones are your sprints, right? Your two-week sprints, and so, these burndown 
charts could be used to measure progress against any milestone, not just sprints.
So, what they are is a measure of how many story points are completed versus how many story 
points you have in the sprint given time.
So, it's going to show you that given this amount of story points in this amount of time you should 
be here, and you want to make sure that you're on that line.
You'll see what they, uh, what they look like, uh, over time the story points remaining to go down, 
right? So, there's less and less story points to, uh, to execute and that's why they call it a burndown 
chart.
You're watching the story points... left the story points remaining burning down over time.
So, let's take a look at an example burndown chart.
On the vertical, I have the number of story points in the sprint and so this will be different for every 
sprint and clearly for every team. It's the number of story points in this particular milestone, which 
is a sprint, then on the horizontal I have the number of days in a sprint.
And this is a two-week sprint. And then I have vertical bars that indicate the weekends. Now this 
particular sprint is going from a Wednesday to a Wednesday, otherwise you would see it start out 
with the vertical bars in the beginning, uh, and then it plots the optimal path through the burndown.
So, everything being equal, and if you're burning down on an equal basis, you will burndown to the 
first weekend, and it doesn't assume that people are working on weekends.
You do not want to burn out your team. And then it plots the next course from that week and then 
the final burndown at the end. And then as the team starts working, you'll see this blue line. Now 
every dot on that blue line is a closed story or you can set it to be a done story, move to the done 
column, but each one of those is a story that has been completed in some way. And so, we're 
looking pretty good right up until now. Up until about halfway through and then we continue and 
then wow, something's going on here, right?
So, now I see that the number of stories closed is much higher than they need to be in order to make 
this sprint. And so, the team rallies, uh, gets a bunch of stories completed and then finally we do 
make our date.
We get them all completed before the end of the sprint.
So, it's just very quick, it's very easy to read, it's very simple for developers.
And again, this is not necessarily for management. This is for the development team to understand,
are we going to meet the sprint goals? Are we going to get all the stories done in time?
This is a pretty good indication that's why I like these charts.

In this video, you learn that a burndown chart shows the measurement of story points completed
versus story points remaining for a sprint, burndown charts can be used to show progress towards 
any milestone not just sprints, burndown charts are used to forecast the team's probability of 
achieving the sprint goal.


The Sprint Review

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe what a Sprint review is.
Explain who to invite to a Sprint review meeting, and describe how to conduct a sprint review 
meeting.
So we've been through all the steps in the scrum process, through the sprint.
And now hopefully, we've got a valuable product, a valuable done increment to demonstrate.
The sprint review meeting is demo time, that's when the developers get to show up all the great 
work that they did.
You want to have live demonstrations of, "Here's the feature we added, here's what it does, what do 
you think about it?"
And then the product owner goes off and says, "Yep, that's what we wanted or maybe, hey, that's 
really cool.
What if we did this, maybe write a new story for it."
But they're determining based on the acceptance criteria, is this acceptable?
And then all the stories that are accepted,
get moved from the Done column into the Closed column.
Because now everyone agrees that story can be closed, we've delivered that functionality.
So who should attend this meeting?
Well, everybody, the product owner, the scrum master, the developers, the stakeholders, the 
customers.
Anybody you can think of, right, anybody who wants to see a demo can come to this meeting.
This is the time when the developers really shine, right, when the development team gets to show 
off all their stuff.
So everyone is welcome to this, to the sprint review meeting to see how they've been working on 
this increment.
So let's talk about the sprint review, feedback should be converted into backlog items.
So what you want to do in the sprint review is get feedback from the stakeholders, feedback from 
the product owner.
Feedback from everyone watching the demo, and then decide, well, maybe we should write new 
stories based on this feedback.
To add some new functionality, or take it in a different direction, or whatever.
So this is where iterative development allows you to build things you could not have
built before.
Because quite often, once they see something, right, once a stakeholder sees something like, "Now 
that I've seen that, you know would be great if we could just add another one of these?" And they 
would have never thought of it.
It would have never happened in Waterfall development, because that process wouldn't have 
spurred their interest.
And this is really, really where you build products that you could not have built with just using the 
fixed planning method.
This is where iterative planning really thrives. So, what do you do about rejected stories?
What do you do about stories that the product owner says, "No, that wasn't what we wanted at all?"
Well, any story that is not considered done, you have to treat carefully.
I want to make sure that you don't just move them to the next sprint.
What I usually do is I add a label to them to let them know it's unfinished.
Or it's done, or was inaccurate, or whatever and then I close it.
Why do I close it?
I close it because I don't want to affect my velocity, impact my velocity unnecessarily.
So I opened a new story with whatever it is they really did want and I close that one.
And this is really key to make sure that if you had eight story points.
And the developers put eight story points into it, and you just move it to the next sprint.
Well, you just lost eight story points out of your velocity, but your velocity is no longer accurate.
Because you did take time to do eight story points instead of 18, you did 10.
It's like, well, what happened that Sprint, it's not that they didn't do any work.
It's that the work wasn't accepted as what the product owner wanted.
But you still want that velocity reflect that eight story points was put into it, even though you didn't 
get something of the product owner wanted.
So I always close those stories and I write a new story for what the product owner really wants, with 
new acceptance criteria for the next sprint.

In this video, you learn that a sprint review is a demonstration of the features that have been 
implemented during the sprint.
Everyone involved with the project is invited to participate, and feedback from stakeholders is 
critical to help shape the future of the product.
The backlog is updated based on the feedback.

The Sprint Retrospective

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe a sprint retrospective, explain who
to invite to a sprint retrospective meeting, and describe how to conduct a sprint retrospective
meeting. So, one of the last meetings is the sprint retrospective. This is a meeting to reflect on the
sprint. Very, very critical for, uh, continuously improving is, that we look back on what we did.
So, it measures the health of the process, measures the health of the team, and the development 
team must be able to speak freely, right? They have to be comfortable in this meeting, that they 
could talk about anything that, you know, they want to talk about and discuss as they reflect on the 
sprint. And so, who should attend this meeting?
Well, the scrum master should be there and the development team. I do not invite the product 
owner to the sprint retrospective.
And the reason I don't invite the product owner is because I want the development team to be able
to speak freely. I want to be able to say, hey, that product owner is driving us too hard, right? I want
them to be able to... them and the scrum master, to have frank and honest conversations about how
are things going? Now you might have a product owner where you can tell them, "You're driving us
too hard." Okay, then invite the product owner, but you don't want people to feel intimidated while
I was really going to tell you what went wrong but I didn't want the product owner to think any less 
of me. You don't want that to happen, so trust me on this one. Sprint retrospective, scrum master,
the rest of the team, without the product owner. And let's really dig into the health of the team.
And so, there are three questions again, uh, that get asked in this team to reflect on the sprint.
The first one is what did we do well, right? What should we keep doing? What went really good? 
You know, uh, and keep doing more of that. And then what did not go well, right? What should we 
stop doing?
And have everybody speak freely about, you know, what did not go well and what they'd like to not 
have to do next time. And then, most importantly, what should we do to change, right? What do you 
want to change for the next time? Now, there might be a lot of changes, uh, it's the scrum master's 
job to kind of document those changes and then make sure that something
gets changed. You don't have to change all of them. It may be impossible to get them all done, but 
make sure something gets addressed, uh, for the next sprint so that the team knows that it's just not a 
gripe session, right? That things are actually happening, people are really listening, people really 
care about how they feel, and they're trying to improve. So, the goal here is improvement.
It's critical to have a healthy team to be able to reflect and be able to talk about what went right,
what went wrong, what should we do differently, and the scrum master must ensure, right, that  
changes are, you know, as a result of feedback changes are made, right? People want to feel that 
that things are getting better as a result of having these meetings, otherwise, there's no sense in 
having the meeting.
And the goal is just to improve for the next sprint. What can we do better for next
time? There's always room for change. What can we do better the next time?

In this video, you learned that a sprint retrospective is a time to reflect on how the sprint went, the 
development team must feel comfortable to speak freely, and the three questions are answered 
on what went right or wrong.
The sprint retrospective must result in changes to improve the next sprint.

Measuring Success
Using Measurements Effectively

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe the difference between vanity
metrics and actionable metrics.
Describe the top four actionable metrics and explain how metrics can be used to improve the team's 
performance.
Having metrics is critically important, because you can't improve what you can't measure.
You have to be able to measure how you're doing, you can't just go by gut feel.
The high performing teams are measuring how they're doing and they're reacting to those 
measurements and they're making sure that those are going in the right direction.
And so they take baselines, they set goals and then they measure against those goals.
This is critically, critically important for the health of your team.
So beware of vanity metrics.
We got 10,000 hits to our website.
Let's have a pizza party.
What does 10,000 hits mean?
What does it really mean?
Did somebody nervously click 10,000 times?
Did 10,000 people click once and go away?
You don't know, you have no idea.
You don't know what drove them to the website and you don't know what action to take next.
How do I get more clicks?
I don't know, clicks or hits to the website is just a vanity metric.
You want to be working on actionable metrics.
So maybe you're doing some A/B split-testing, right?
Where you've got two versions of something, you don't know how the customers are going to like 
it.
And so you traffic shape 50% to one customer set, 50 to another.
And then you measure, right?
Did the customers who saw the new feature, did they react the way we want them to do?
We get the behavior out of them, and if we did, then let's do more of that behavior.
And if they didn't, then let's not do more of that behavior, right?
Let's do less.
So it's critical that you take a baseline, whatever that baseline is, let's say it currently requires six 
teams, 10 hours to make it to a deployment.
And you want to decrease that or it costs so much, money to do a release, whatever it is.
However you have the baseline, you pick something that you want to improve on and then you 
measure it the way it is today, set that baseline and then you set yourself a goal.
Maybe you want to reduce from 10 hours to two hours and you think about how can I do that?
Right? And then you measure it?
Or are we getting closer?
You're not going to get it the first time, right?
This is going to be over a series of sprints, are we getting faster?
Are we getting better?
Is it costing us less?
Are we finding more bugs in production?
I'm sorry, more bugs in testing, right?
You don't want to find more bugs in production.
Are we picking up more bugs in testing than we do in production?
Right? Which is going to cost us less money and doing break fix.
So whatever that is, you want to set a goal and measure against it.
The top four actionable metrics that people use our mean lead time, right?
How long does it take to get from an idea, to get something delivered to the customer?
Release frequency, how often can you release?
It doesn't have to be any faster than you need to release.
If you only need to release once a week, that's fine.
But can you release when you need to release something new to the customer and
then of course, what is your change failure rate?
Right. Are you releasing stuff that's breaking, right?
So that's critically important as well.
And then mean time to recovery, it used to be mean time to failure, right?
We make sure we never fail, make sure it never goes down.
Well, It's going to go down, how fast can you recover from it going down as the question.
And if it's quick enough and the customer doesn't even notice, that is the best of all.
So, mean time to recovery is really what people are measuring as an actionable metric today.
So, let's look at some example metrics, right?
Reduce time to market for new features, right?
How fast does it take me to get a new feature out there? Does it take me days? Weeks?
Months? Increasing the overall availability of the product, right?
Maybe you want to make something a higher availability, reducing the time it takes to deploy 
release.
That's that's a common one, right?
You want to be able to get releases out quicker.
Increasing the percentage of defects detected and testing before a production release, because that is 
going to save you money in the long run.
And then providing performance and user feedback to the team in a timely manner, right?
Do I have fast feedback loops?
Can I get feedback from the customer to my team?
Maybe I want to get there quicker, I don't want to take so long.
Whatever those metrics are, you want to pick one of them and then improve on it.

In this video, you learn that high performing teams use metrics to continuously improve.
It's important to be sure that the metrics you use are actionable.
It's important to take a baseline before trying to measure change.
And the top four actionable metrics can be used to improve your team's overall performance.

Getting Ready for the Next Sprint

After watching this video, you'll be able to close out the sprint on the Kanban board,
describe how to handle unfinished stories, and prepare for your next sprint.
I want to talk about the end of sprint activities. What do you do at the end of a sprint
after all the meetings are done? Well, you want to take anything
that's in the done column and move it to closed. You might have done that during the sprint review,
but if you didn't, now is the time to move all of the done items into the closed column.
You also want to close out the current milestone. If you're using sprints in the new ZenHub, they 
may close themselves out based on the end date, but a regular milestone in GitHub will not close 
itself until you close it just in case you run late.
So, you're in control of closing it. And so, you should close out that milestone, so you get credit for 
velocity on your velocity charts.
You then want to create a new sprint milestone. Now you might leave this until the next sprint
planning meeting, and that's okay, but just understand you close out one milestone you're going to 
have to create a new milestone for the next sprint.
And then you want to adjust any unfinished work. So, what do I mean about unfinished work?
Well, there's untouched stories. What about stories that haven't been worked on?
They're in the sprint backlog and no one got to them, right?
So, you can move those to the top of the product backlog.
Some people move them to the next sprint. I like to resist the urge of just moving them into the next 
sprint because, what if they're not the top priority anymore?
What if, we didn't get to those stories but in the middle of the sprint a new, uh, feature was 
requested, that is our new top priority.
So, I don't make any assumptions that just because we were working on it the last sprint, we ought 
to be working on the next sprint if it wasn't finished.
And so, I like to take them and move them to the top of the product backlog.
If you do, remember to unassign them from the sprint milestone, right, you don't want to have
those dangling stories in the sprint milestone. Take them out of the milestone, move them back
to the top of the product backlog.
How about unfinished stories?
These are stories that people did get to, but they didn't finish.
Very important for this, is don't move the unfinished stories into the next sprint. Again, you're going 
to mess up your velocity. Somebody spent time working on half a story and so what you should do 
is you could determine, uh, you know, was the sizing wrong, uh, if it was, you can adjust it. If it 
wasn't wrong, okay, it was an eight pointer, I only got to do four points of it, then adjust the size 
down to four and then write a new story because you want to keep your velocity accurate. Write a 
new story for the... put it in the product backlog, that's the other four points.
But give the developer credit and give the team credit for working on those four story points.
So, you never want to simply move them into the next sprint.
You want to take them and close them in this sprint, so you get credit for the velocity, and then if 
you need to, write a story for the next sprint with maybe more story points or half of the story points 
from the previous one. The other thing you want to do is adjust the description, right? You might 
want to say that this thing is unfinished. You might want to create an unfinished label, you know, so 
that you can tell that it was closed but it wasn't closed and completed, maybe, a not completed label 
but the idea is that you definitely want to identify in some way that this is a half-finished story. But 
you're closing it because you're closing out the sprint and the work was done in that sprint even 
though it was only half of the work.
Then you write a new story for the remaining work, right?
So whatever work is left and maybe it's the remaining story points or maybe it's even more story 
points because it was bigger than we thought, whatever it is, you write that story, put it in the 
product backlog, and then we could decide whether we're going to do it or not in the next sprint. Or 
maybe because it's half done, you're guaranteed, you know, that you want to do it in the next sprint, 
uh, then you might want to move it to the next sprint, assuming you've already created that sprint 
milestone.
And then you want to remain, if you do write a new story, assign the remaining story points to that 
new story.
Again, what we're trying to do is keep the velocity accurate.
We want to get credit for the number of story points executed in a sprint regardless of whether
the story was finished or not so that we know that our velocity is accurate in the next sprint.
We know how many story points we can take on to execute.
So, getting ready for the next sprint, all the current stories should be assigned to, uh, the current 
sprint should be closed, right? Anything in the current sprint, you want to close that. All the 
unfinished stories, they get reassigned. So, you've handled all the stories are unfinished... close 
them, maybe write new stories for the rest to finish them and then any of the sprint milestone is 
closed, any stories that were in that sprint milestone get taken out of it, put in the product backlog, 
uh, and then maybe a new sprint milestone is created either at the end of the sprint or at the 
beginning of the next sprint.

In this video, you learned that it is important to give developers credit for unfinished stories, 
unfinished stories should be split into new stories to complete the work in the next sprint, each 
sprint milestone should be closed when completed to reflect the velocity of the sprint, and you 
should create a new milestone for the next sprint.


Agile Anti-Patterns and Health Check

After watching this video, you'll be able to discuss some anti-patterns to avoid when practising 
scrum, and describe a checklist for measuring a healthy scrum team.
So, let's discuss some anti-patterns. The first one is no real product owner. And I've seen this happen
on a number of teams where nobody's really sure who the product owner is. There are a couple of
people who seem to be in charge, uh, but clearly one person with a vision, uh, you know is not 
present.
The other opposite I've seen is multiple product owners. I've been on scrum teams where there were
two product owners and they didn't always agree on what to build. These are anti-patterns. There
should be a clear person who's playing the role of product owner, who's the visionary for the team, 
who's setting the vision, and leading the team. Very, very important. Then if the teams are too large, 
you don't want to have, you know, 20-30 people on a team. They should be less than 10. We say, 
you know, five plus or minus two or seven plus or minus two.
You really don't want to have large teams because that is an anti-pattern, uh, because 
communications becomes too hard at that point and then the teams are not dedicated. I've seen this
happen multiple times. People are on multiple projects. You're in the daily stand-up and you say, 
What did you do yesterday?" and "Oh, yesterday, my manager pulled me off to work on another 
project."
Clearly, that is an anti-pattern. You know that is a recipe for disaster. So, you want to make sure that 
if that's happening on your teams, your teams are not going to be successful.
If the teams are too geographically dispersed... I realize we work in international companies all
around the world, you know, my recommendation is put at least two people in a geography, in
a time zone, so they can collaborate together, um, but it really works best when all the teams are 
together in one time zone, one geography. And then if your teams are siloed, you know, the team
should be working as one cross-functional team. I shouldn't have to open tickets with other teams to 
get things done. Everything I need should be on that one team so that's very, uh, important.
And then teams are not self-managing. The teams are not being told what to do, right? They're not
being given stories to work on. The stories are in the backlog and they pick the next highest story 
off the backlog and they assign it to themselves, right? They're self-managing.
It's critically important for the health of a scrum team. If you do these things you will fail.
You should not wonder why you failed. You know you were implementing all the anti-patterns. So, 
let's
talk about some health check items that you can look at and make sure that your team is healthy.
One of them is that everybody is accountable. Scrum master, product owner, team members, uh, 
you know, they all are accountable for what they do. They all feel ownership and what they're 
delivering, uh, and when something goes wrong everybody chips in to make sure things happen 
right. So, they should all understand what their role is and act on that role. The second is that you're 
working in small sprints.
Uh, if you're working in sprints that are a month long, two months long that's just too big. You 
need...
you need to be organized around one or one to two weeks, two or four-week sprints. I don't like
four weeks. I really like two-week sprints. Some people do one-week sprints. There's an ordered
product backlog. This is key, right? If you go in and look at the backlog and it's not ordered you 
know things are in disarray and the stories don't have enough information for anybody to know
what's going on. That's an indication that things aren't exactly healthy. Then, is there a sprint 
backlog, right? That you could visualize the remaining work. That's why we use a kanban board, 
right? So, we have these things in the backlog. We can look at them and very quickly  the work 
that's remaining in this sprint? What is the work that has has yet to be done? And then at sprint 
planning and forecast, a sprint backlog and a sprint are created.
Teams should not be working without a backlog. Teams should not be pulling off the product 
backlog.
You really want to organize around a goal for the sprint and all the stories for that sprint are in
that sprint backlog. The results of the daily scrum results in planning work or replanning work so
maybe, you know, something's not going as planned, you need to shuffle some stories, you need to 
add more people to a story. You need to get somebody help, uh, and maybe, you know, you replan 
as a result of that. So that's very, very important. No later than the end of the sprint, you've got it 
done increment, right? You don't want to have sprints where there's nothing to deliver. In the 
beginning, it's really hard to do this but once you get going there should be some new functionality
that you're adding every two weeks that you can be, uh, you can demo and be accountable for.
And then the stakeholder's offering feedback. I can't stress enough how critically important
this is. The whole idea of delivering early and often is so that the stakeholders can look at
it and they can offer you feedback and then you could decide whether you need to change the plan
or change the product or change whatever direction you're going in. So that stakeholder feedback is
very valuable. If you have sprint reviews and the stakeholders remain silent, not healthy.
Not healthy. They really need to be speaking up and saying whether they like it don't like it, The 
product backlog is updated as a result of a sprint review, so when you do the review you may come 
up with new stories. You came up with new ideas, uh, you may decide that something should be 
implemented a little differently and so at the end of that review you go in and you add these new 
stories to the backlog, right? You want to take that feedback that the stakeholders giving you and 
add that to the sprint backlog so that becomes new stories that you could implement for your 
stakeholders. And then the product owner, the development team, the scrum master, they're all 
aligned on the work in process, right? So they know what's going to happen for their next sprint,
uh at the sprint retrospective. You want to make sure everybody understands what went well, what 
didn't go well, what should we keep doing, what should we stop doing, and get alignment, so that in 
the next sprint, we do even better, right? We incrementally improve.

In this video, you learned anti-patterns to avoid when practising scrum, no real product owner, 
teams are too large, teams are not dedicated, teams are too geographically dispersed, teams are 
siloed, teams are not self-managing. The scrum health check provides guidelines for measuring a 
healthy scrum team.


Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:  
•	High performing teams use metrics to continually improve 
•	It is important to be sure that the metrics you use are actionable 
•	You should take a baseline before trying to measure change.
•	It is important to give developers credit for unfinished stories 
•	Unfinished stories should be split into new stories to complete the work in the next sprint 
•	Each sprint milestone should be closed when completed to reflect the velocity of the sprint 
•	You should create a new milestone for the next sprint
•	The top 4 actionable metrics can be used to improve your team's overall performance
- Mean Lead Time (How long does it take from idea to production?) 
- Release Frequency (How often can you deliver changes?) 
- Change Failure Rate (How often do changes fail?) 
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) (How quickly can you recover from failure?) 
•	Anti-patterns to avoid when practicing Scrum include:
- No real product owner
-Teams are too large
-Teams are not dedicated
-Teams are too geographically distributed
-Teams are siloed
-Teams are not self-managing

Scenario Introduction and 
Project Initiation
Introduction:
Welcome to Module 1 of the Project Management Professional Certificate (PC) Capstone course. 
This course provides you the opportunity to apply the project management knowledge and skills 
learned in the previous eight courses of the Project Management Professional Certificate (PC).
Module 1 introduces a comprehensive scenario and project initiation activities to include 
development of a project charter and stakeholder register. Here is an overview of Module 1:
•	We start with the project scenario: Acme Health Innovations (AHI) is a major provider of 
advanced skin care products. The goal of this project is to develop an application (app) that 
provides real-time marketing data to address marketing shortfalls. Three scenario documents 
are provided, including an overview of AHI, an approved business case to create a formal 
project, and a Stacey diagram analysis that defines how seven key project objectives will be 
planned and executed.
•	The project scenario provides an overview of AHI and the purpose of the project. The 
scenario defines the key business contacts, the requirements for the functionality of the new 
app, the benefits that the app should provide, the improvements to the AHI marketing 
processes that the app will ensure, the benefits to the various stakeholders, and an initial cost 
estimate for the project.
•	The project business case defines the business need for the project, the project rationale, and 
the project implementation strategy. It is an approved business case that allows for the 
development of a project charter.
•	The Stacey diagram analysis shows the project goals and recommends planning and 
implementing the project with both predictive (waterfall) and adaptive (Agile/Scrum) 
methods.
•	A short instructional video provides an overview and example of a project charter and 
stakeholder register. This video shows the specifics of the documents and provides 
instructions on how to complete them.
•	We then ask you and your team to create a project charter and stakeholder register 
using the scenario documents provided. We then present you with a possible solution.
•	This module includes a short, graded, seven-question quiz that covers the key features of 
the project charter and stakeholder register. Note that this quiz is representative of the 
certification questions you may be asked on the Project Management Institute (PMI) 
Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) certification exam.
•	We complete the Module with a glossary of terms and a module summary.
Enjoy Module 1, and welcome to the course.
Your completed project charter and stakeholder register will become part of a portfolio of artefacts 
to demonstrate your project management expertise and readiness for greater project management 
responsibilities.

Project Scenario
Introduction
This course allows you to apply the project management knowledge and skills learned in the 
previous eight Project Management Professional Certificate (PC) courses. You can take a 
preparation test for the Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) at the end. We 
recommend that you complete all previous studies before beginning this.
You will receive a real-world scenario and able to complete numerous hands-on activities. We will 
also provide templates and guidance to help you create a portfolio of artefacts to demonstrate your 
expertise and readiness for higher levels of responsibility in project management.
You will be assessed on the following skills:
•	Analyse a completed business case to drive the creation of a project charter
•	Create a project charter and stakeholder register
•	Develop a work breakdown structure (WBS), network diagram, and high-level budget 
to support a predictive project
•	Develop user stories, complete a product backlog, and develop a sprint backlog to 
support an adaptive or Scrum project segment
•	Complete support planning for the predictive project segment, including a quality 
management plan, a communications management plan, and a risk register
•	Analyse a burndown chart and Kanban board to determine the status of the adaptive 
Scrum segment of the project and propose corrective actions
•	Analyse a change request to determine the most appropriate recommendation and 
develop a status report for the ongoing project
•	Prepare a final project closeout report
The Scenario:
Acme Health Innovations (AHI) primarily provides advanced skin care products. Their product line 
includes advanced technology solutions, such as beautification wands, massagers, facial treatment

However, marketing analytics depends on numerous disconnected systems to provide the 
information needed to adapt to a changing competitive and technological environment.
The corporate team reviewed and approved a business case for developing an app for internal and 
external customers. This app will solicit, collect, and analyse information and data in critical areas 
and provide real-time analytics and information. The initial app will perform the following 
functions:
•	Identify, understand, and address current and developing segments and target markets 
(External)
•	Facilitate easier customer access to AHI products and pricing (External)
•	Enable secure invoicing and order processing (External)
•	Track current market trends in the skin care industry in real-time (Internal)

Summarize the Stacey Analysis
The Acme Health Innovations (AHI) project management team conducted a Stacey analysis to 
determine the best project management lifecycle for implementing the new marketing app.
The team identified seven objectives that were critical to completing the project. The team 
evaluated the project objectives by analysing two key parameters:
Level of agreement 
Certainty
The team decided that five objectives should be implemented using a predictive or waterfall 
method, and two objectives should be implemented using an adaptive or Scrum methodology.

Module 1 Summary: Initiating the Project
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know that:
•	The project scenario contains the key information you will need to plan this project, such as:
•	An overview of the problem and the goals of the project
•	Key corporate contacts you will be working with
•	A list of the functions that the new marketing app must perform
•	A list of the benefits the new APP should provide
•	The current marketing process of AHI and how the new app will improve efficiency
•	Stakeholder expectations for the app
•	Initial project cost estimates
•	A business case is developed and approved. This business case serves as the primary input 
for developing a project charter and subsequent project plan. This business case outlines:
•	The business needs
•	Project justification
•	Business strategy to implement the project
•	A Stacey diagramming analysis evaluates project goals against two key criteria. The first 
criteria is agreement. Agreement measures the degree to which stakeholders agree on what 
the project should accomplish. Low agreement generally leads to many project changes. 
High agreement generally leads to fewer changes. The second criteria is technological 
complexity. It measures the degree of uncertainty and innovation required to successfully 
implement the project.

Good news! The project charter and stakeholder register have been approved. The Project 
Management Institute (PMI) recommends that scope, schedule, and cost be planned in this order 
during initial baseline planning. Your team will follow this recommendation.
The project charter divided the project into five phases for scheduling purposes. The project team 
has decided to tailor the work breakdown structure (WBS), schedule, and high-level budget 
estimate using these phases.
The table below identifies each phase and tasks to be considered in the scope, schedule, and cost 
planning for this project. Note that the key task requirements for the major tasks are not listed in the 
order in which they will occur. When planning scope, schedule, and cost, your team must determine 
the task flow.

Demo: Communications 
Management Review
Welcome to Communications Management Review.

After watching this video, you'll be able to describe the parts of a communications management 
plan.
Welcome to a short demo of a communications management plan.
The purpose of a communications management plan is to describe how, when, and by whom 
information about the project will be administered and disseminated.
Let's walk through an example of a communications management plan and share the format of this 
document.
Step one is project identification.
Identify the project that the communications management plan supports and applied version control.
For example, as you can see on the bottom of this form, this is version one dated 29 February.
We use version control because this plan will likely change.
Step two is to identify the communication item, what is required to be communicated.
In step three, assign an owner to manage the communications item.
Ensure this owner is able to satisfy this role and committed to do so.
In step four, identify the target audience for the communications.
Try to target stakeholders who have a need for the information item.
Avoid sending everything to everybody.
Step five documents the when factor, try to establish a logical schedule that the target audience can 
commit to and follow.
In step six, identify the medium you will use to communicate and share all target audience members
have access and availability.
Finally, in step seven, define the purpose of the communications.
Ensure every stakeholder understands why the communication is pertinent to the project.
Develop the communications management plan as follows.
Number one, determine key communications items required to successfully plan and implement the 
project.
This particular example lists some common communications item entries.
Secondly, verify that all owners have the capacity and the ability to manage
the communications item assigned.
Third, let the target audience understand what the communication item they are
tasked to participate in is, and ensure they understand the purpose for their involvement.
Finally, update the plan on a periodic basis and keep it current.
You will have an opportunity to review the project scenario and determine applicable 
communication planning needs for our project scenario.

In this video, you'll learn that a communications management plan includes project identification,
defining the communication team, naming the target audience, establishing a schedule, describing 
the medium of communication, and defining the purpose of communications.


Demo: Quality Management 
Review


Welcome to quality management review.
After watching this video, you will be able to explain the steps involved in the creation of a quality 
management plan.
>> Welcome to a short demo of a quality management plan.
The purpose of a quality management plan is to describe how policies, procedures, standards and 
guidelines will be implemented to achieve quality objectives.
Policies and procedures are achieved by conducting periodic quality assurance audits.
Quality assurance is preventative and accomplished during project executing process group 
processes.
Guidelines as documented in the project management plan are accomplished by conducting periodic 
quality control inspections.
Quality control is corrective and accomplished during project monitoring and controlling process 
group processes.
A quality management plan is accomplished in five steps.
Step one is project identification, identify the project that the quality management plan supports and
apply version control, this plan will likely change.
Step two is to identify project objectives, these objectives are normally listed in the project charter.
The overall goals of project quality are to conform to requirements and provide a product or service 
that is fit for use.
The project objectives provide the basis to achieve project quality goals.
In step three, define the project quality management team.
The team will normally consist of the project manager, quality assurance and quality control leads, 
subject matter experts and any other stakeholder involved in ensuring quality.
RACI is a common way to define quality team roles.
As a review, RACI stands for, R, responsible, A, accountable, C, consult and I, inform.
In step four, determine quality assurance activities that will be critical to ensure policy, procedure 
and defined standards are being followed.
Be proactive, look for potential problems and prevent them before they become major issues.
Quality assurance activities are accomplished using quality audits.
Finally, in step five, identify quality control activities.
Quality control uses inspections to verify deliverables and correct defects before the product or 
service is transitioned to the customer.
Use the quality management plan to plan and execute your project quality requirements.

In this video, you learn that, the steps involved in creating a quality management plan include, 
project identification, defining objectives, defining the project quality management team, 
determining quality assurance and quality control activities.
Demo: Risk Register Review
Welcome to Risk Register 
Review.
After watching this video, you will be able to name the key entries of a risk register.
Welcome to a short demo to explain the content of a risk register.
A risk register is a tool that lists all risks identified with the potential to impact a project both 
positively or negatively.
Risks are classified as either opportunities or threats.
Let's walk through an example of a risk register and share the format of this document.
There are a number of key entries required to complete a risk register.
Let's examine a risk register example and explain each column moving from top to bottom and left 
to right.
Begin by identifying the project the risk register supports, date the risk register as well.
A risk register is a dynamic document that is updated often.
Use risk metalanguage to document risks.
Risk metalanguage identifies a risk by describing the cause or risk condition, the event that may 
result from the cause, and the potential impact of the event to the project.
Each risk should be assigned to a risk owner.
This role is responsible for analysing the risk, periodically reassessing the risk, and developing and 
implementing responses if the risk becomes an issue.
There are many ways to categorize risks.
You may choose to categorize by functions such as finance or Information Technology, or you may 
choose to categorize as shown on this example, by opportunity or threat.
All risk registers should share a scale to determine the probability and impact rating for the risk.
Probability is the chance that the risk will occur.
Impact is a measure of the consequences of the risk to the project if it does occur.
A risk score is the product of probability times impact.
The higher the score, the more attention you want to give the risk.
Note that threats are given a positive number, opportunities are given a negative number.
More on this in a moment.
Some risks may have a trigger.
This is an early warning that a risk is about to occur.
Triggers lead to the need to implement a risk response.
Finally, each risk should have a potential response.
For threats, the goal is to avoid the risk cause or mitigate the probability and/or impact.
For opportunities, the goal is to exploit the opportunity or enhance the probability and/or impact of 
the opportunity occurring.
Always total up the project risk score.
The higher the score, the more risk a project potentially faces.
Threats add to the overall risk score.
Opportunities, on the other hand, reduce overall risk score.
Many project managers track the overall project risk score.
They trend these scores as a measure of overall project risk exposure.
When the score increases, exposure increases, when the score decreases, overall exposure 
decreases.
Use a risk register to your advantage.
It is said that if you fail to manage risk, risk will manage you.

In this video, you learn that the key entries of a risk register are project identification, describing the 
risk condition, assigning a risk owner, categorizing the risk, defining a rating, determining the score, 
and identifying risk triggers.
Scenario: Develop an 
Application (App) to Provide 
Real-Time Marketing Data
Good news! Your work breakdown structure (WBS), project network diagram, and high-level 
budget have been approved. It's now time to begin project support planning. You have met with 
your sponsor Mary Smithers, and she has emphasized the need for a robust quality management 
program to ensure that the project meets requirements and creates an app that fits the purpose. This 
requires an effective quality assurance program for all phases of the project and quality control to 
ensure that all project deliverables are free of defects.
One of your key team members, Keiko Tanaka, stated she is well-versed in quality assurance 
and quality control processes. Priya Service from IT and Ram Samuels from Marketing stated 
that they would like to act as subject matter experts to ensure the quality of app development 
and IT support activities. It was determined that an external vendor would be brought on board 
to work with the internal development team on app development.
Mary also emphasized the need for effective communication. She called for weekly status 
meetings to include all key stakeholders. She also recommended establishing a change control 
board (CCB). Mary requested that you meet with her weekly in her office to discuss the project. 
She also stressed the need for solid communication throughout the project's procurement process.
Mary strongly believes that if you fail to manage the risk, the risk will manage you. She would like 
to see a comprehensive risk register that addresses both threats and opportunities. Mary has 
concerns about the availability of feedback, the ability to hire the talent she needs, and the 
availability of quality training.
It's time to get to work!

Module 3: Overview and 
Activity Requirements
Objective:
•	Provide an overview of Module Three to include activity requirements
Introduction
Welcome to Module Three of the Project Management Professional Certificate (PC) Capstone 
course. This course allows you to apply the project management knowledge and skills learned in the 
previous eight Project Management Professional Certificate (PC) courses.
Module Three introduces the adaptive or Scrum portion of our course. Part of the project scenario is 
to develop an app that provides real-time marketing data to AHI Inc. using Scrum methodology.
Here is an overview of Module Three:
•	We now begin to develop User Stories, a Product Backlog, and a Sprint Backlog to support 
the AHI app development in Lesson One. You will be provided with templates and 
examples.
•	We begin with a short Instructional video that provides an overview and example of a User 
Story, Product Backlog, and Sprint Backlog. This video shows the specifics of the 
documents and provides instructions on how to complete them.
•	We then ask you and your team to create User Stories, a prioritized Product Backlog, and a 
Sprint Backlog using the previously described documents. We also give you clarifying 
information in the lab introduction. You will be provided with plausible solutions for your 
reference and further learning.
•	We end the first lesson with a short, graded, seven-question quiz on the key Scrum concepts 
in Lesson One. The quiz is representative of certifications questions from the Project 
Management Institute (PMI) Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) 
certification exam. In addition, these questions will help you pass the Certified Scrum 
Master (CSM) and Disciplined Agile Scrum Master (DASM) certification exams.
•	Lesson two starts with a short reading that introduces the concept of a Kanban board and 
explains burndown charts.
•	We then provide you with a Kanban board and burndown chart and ask you to analyze the 
problems presented in these documents. You will assess what changes the team should make 
now and what changes the team should have made earlier.
•	The second lesson includes a short, graded, seven-question quiz on other Scrum concepts 
covered. The quiz is representative of certifications questions from the Project Management 
Institute (PMI) Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM) certification exam. In 
addition, these questions will help you pass the Certified Scrum Master (CSM) and 
Disciplined Agile Scrum Master (DASM) certification exams.
•	We conclude the module with a glossary of terms and a summary of Module Three.
Enjoy Module Three. The hands-on lab deliverables you create will become part of a portfolio of 
artifacts to demonstrate your project management expertise and readiness for larger project 
management responsibilities.
Demo: User Story Review
Welcome to User Story Review.
After watching this video, you will be able to describe the parts of a user story.
Welcome to a brief demo on user stories.
User stories are developed by the product owner and placed in a prioritized product backlog.
User stories scheduled for completion in the next sprint are selected during sprint planning by the 
team.
The team bases its selection on velocity considerations.
Velocity is a measure of how many stories can be completed to done in a given sprint.
Velocity is generally based on story points.
A User story has two parts.
Part 1 is general information formatted by role, need, and value statements.
As you can see in this example, each user story is given a title.
In this example, the title is simply the first user story supporting the customer role.
In part 1, the user story should tell a story.
For example, as a rule, I need a capability to provide desired value.
Part 2 of the user story lists acceptance criteria.
This is an overview of measurable objectives the development team will build to support the user 
story.
The goal of the team during the sprint is to build 100% of the acceptance criteria.
One hundred percent completion of a user story is referred to as done.
In this video, you learned hat a user story should include a role, a capability, and the desired value.
Demo: Product Backlog Review
Welcome to Product Backlog.
After watching this video, you will be able to explain the components of a product backlog.
Welcome to a brief demo on a product backlog, the product backlog serves as a repository for all 
confirmed user stories.
User stories are placed into the product backlog by the product owner once the story is confirmed 
by both the customer and the team.
User stories are prioritized based on value to the customer.
User stories scheduled for development in the near term must be detailed appropriately and
able to be broken out into tasks that can be assigned and estimated.
A product backlog contains the following as you can see in this example, each user story has a 
distinct Identifier number.
Each user story is prioritized, each user story is categorized.
A common categorization method is simply sharing the role the user story supports.
In some cases, a firm may employ multiple scrum teams.
If this is the case, list the name responsible the team name responsible for the user story.
Identify the role, need and value and acceptance criteria as listed on the user story.
Assign story points to each user story, more on this in a moment and finally provide any clarifying 
comments.
In this example, we list the sprint when the user story will be implemented.
Now let's discuss story points, story points are a measure of the overall complexity of a user story.
Complexity is determined through a process called relative estimation.
In this example, we show five user stories, to perform relative estimation, we review user story 
number one.
The team discusses complexity factors, place user story number 1 in the middle of the grid.
Next, review user story number 2, the team discusses complexity factors.
In this case, the team determines user story is less complex than user story 1, place user story 2 to 
the left of user story number 1.
Next, review user story number 3, the team determined user story 3 is equally complex as user story 
1, place user story 3 under user story 1.
Next, review user story 4.
The team determined user story 4 is more complex than user stories 1 and
3, place user story 4 to the right of user stories 1 and 3.
Finally, review user story 5.
The team determined this user story is less complex than user story 2, place story 5 to the left of 
user story 2.
We are now ready to place the user stories into the appropriate story point columns.
These columns follow a numbering system developed by Mike Cone based on Fibonacci numbering 
system.
Story points of 1,2,3,5 and 8 are used to show that complexity does not increase in a mathematically 
linear way.
Finally, we can now total up our story points, let's see how this looks in the relative estimation 
solution.
As you can see, we have a total of 14 story points.

In this video, you learn that the main components of a product backlog include priorities, categories, 
user stories, story points, and clarifying comments.


Demo: Sprint Backlog Review
Welcome to Sprint Backlog Review.
After watching this video, you will be able to summarize the features of a sprint backlog.
Welcome to our final demo on a sprint backlog.
A sprint backlog is created by the development team.
A sprint backlog is much like a traditional work breakdown structure.
The sprint backlog breaks out each user story into assignable tasks that can be measured to ensure 
completion and determine time required.
Let's review an example and highlight some sprint backlog features.
First of all, always list the project that the sprint backlog supports.
Next, list the personnel resources required to complete the user story by task.
Normally, a team member is assigned as the lead to manage development efforts of the user story 
and facilitate discussions to determine the tasks.
Tasks normally conform to the acceptance criteria documented in the user story.
As a note, the team self organizes.
They determine internally who will lead the user story efforts and who will work on each task.
Ask each task lead to determine how much time their task will require to complete, this is normally 
accomplished in hours.
Total up the hours to complete the user story.
In this example, user story one requires 77 hours, user story two requires 30 hours and the total hour 
requirement for the entire sprint is 107 hours.
At the beginning of each day, each team member will share what they accomplished, what they are 
working on, and share any blockers at the daily scrum meeting, they will also provide an update of 
the hours remaining.
The scrum master will often use the time required and time remaining to develop, burn-down or 
burn-up charts.
A burn-down chart is most common.
It shows the total time required to accomplish the sprint and compare it to the work remaining.
The goal is to complete all user stories and tasks by the end of the sprint.

In this video, you learn that the sprint backlog should incorporate required personnel resources and 
time estimations for task completion.

Scenario: Develop an Application (App) to 
Provide Real-Time Marketing Data
It is now time to begin the Sprint Planning for the project. The original project scenario defined 
functionality required by various stakeholders from the new App. Here is a quick review of the 
functionality requirements and a more detailed list of the needs of each role. This list will serve as a 
basis to develop user stories. The team also briefly reviewed the complexity level of each 
stakeholder's need. This will assist you in assigning story points to each user story.

Reading: Kanban board and Burndown Chart 
Review

Welcome to a brief overview of two critical scrum information radiators. The definition of an 
information radiator is: "A visible, physical display that provides information to the rest of 
the organization." Information radiators allow the team to receive up-to-date information in real-
time without disturbing them.
Information radiators also support the concept of Osmotic Communications. Osmotic 
Communication is defined as "Accidental overhearing of background information that may 
later become important." This lesson briefly introduces two key information radiators, including a 
burndown chart and a Kanban Board.
Burndown Chart
A burndown chart is a graphical representation of the work remaining in a Sprint compared 
to the time remaining. Burndown charts allow the team to understand Sprint's status, review 
planned versus actual work accomplished, and make course corrections promptly.

This illustration shows a Sprint that planned to complete eighty hours of work. Note the planned 
line on the chart. It is now the end of day seven. The team has thirty-nine hours of work remaining. 
The goal was to have thirty-two hours of work remaining by the end of day seven. The orange line 
that indicates the actual rate on the burndown chart shows the team is behind schedule by seven 
hours.
The Scrum Master gathers task completion information at the daily Scrum meeting. The Scrum 
Master uses this status to update the burndown chart and work with the team to take follow-up 
actions to stay on course.
Kanban Board
A Kanban Board visually displays the work in a Sprint. The Kanban Board belongs to the team, 
is the focus of the daily scrum meeting, and serves as a key information radiator. A Kanban 
Board is physically located in the team's work area or is electronically generated and maintained.
Here is an illustration of a Kanban Board:

In this example:
•	Column one lists the user story by identifier and the team members who will accomplish the 
tasks. It is common for each team member to choose a distinct color for the jobs they are 
completing.
•	Column two lists tasks ready for development by the team.
•	Column three lists tasks in progress. Some teams apply "Work in Progress (WIP)" limits to 
manage workload to ensure the team is not trying to accomplish too many tasks 
simultaneously. WIP limits indicates limited resources or capacity.
•	Column four lists tasks "Done." Recall the definition of "Done." Done indicates completed 
user acceptance criteria according to customer satisfaction.
•	Column five shows tasks that are blocked. The Scrum Master asks each team member if 
there are any blockers at the daily Scrum meeting. Kanban board A displays blocked 
tasks. The Scrum Master addresses blocked tasks as soon as possible to ensure the 
Sprint can progress.
The Kanban Board format is not prescribed. This example conforms with illustrations provided 
by the Project Management Institute (PMI).

Scenario: Develop an Application (App) to Provide Real-Time 
Marketing Data
The AHI development team is working to complete all app development deliverables supporting the 
project. They are using the Scrum methodology.
The team plans to complete development in two Sprints. (Note: Sprint Backlog Lab Solution 
reference). It identified five user stories, estimated at 20 story points. The team assumed it could 
complete 10 story points in each Sprint. It budgeted 165 hours for Sprint 1 and 170 hours for Sprint 
2. The team estimated 335 hours as the total time for the entire app development and scheduled 
each Sprint to last 30 days.
The team is new, and the members do not know each other. The group consists of two internal 
developers and one external development consultant. Cal Hamer is the product owner. Cal 
understands the needs of the customers well. However, he is new to the Product Owner position. 
AHI does not have a Scrum Master to support app development. Cary Manning is the designated 
Scrum Master. Cary is well-versed in predictive project management methods. However, he has no 
experience in Scrum.
The Sprint 1 User Story was 0004, developed to ensure that all IT hardware, software, and 
interfaces were installed to support the new app. Cary worked with the team to create an updated 
Sprint Backlog. He assigned tasks to team members and held a daily one-hour meeting to discuss 
status. He also developed a change form to manage changes. The team initially developed an IT 
infrastructure to support 500 internal and 20 million external app users.
User story 0002 dealt with marketing support requirements. After the Sprint began, Cal worked with 
marketing staff and updated the user story to reflect the new needs. Cal scheduled a meeting with 
marketing and the team to discuss the changes.
The first demo for Sprint 1 surprised the stakeholders. They informed the team that the app should 
support 200 internal and four million external users. That notice came too late. IT invested in more 
infrastructure than the app realistically needed. Cary determined that issues were impacting the 
budget and schedule for the app development and used the Sprint 1 retrospective as a forum for a 
comprehensive root-cause analysis and development of solutions to support Sprint 2.
The team is now in Sprint 2. It encountered issues on user story 0001 and completed only 20 of the 
planned 40 hours. Some key executives added reporting requirements not included in the original 
user story.
The team reviewed the project network diagram and found that the total development cycle for the 
app was 90 days. Cal realized that the five planned user stories in the product backlog did not 
include updating the original app prototype and developing an initial launch plan. AHI leadership 
approved the network diagram and a 90-day development cycle. The current roadmap calls for two 
60-day Sprints.
Cary and Cal worked together to create a burndown chart for the entire app development phase of 
the project. Here is the current version:

Module four covers predictive monitoring and controlling and closeout activities and highlights 
status reporting, managing change, and closeout reporting. Effective status reporting, change 
management, and closeout are critical to project management success.
•	You'll begin with a short update on the AHI App development project as a whole. You will 
use this update to create a project status report.
•	Next, you'll view a short demonstration video illustrating a status report and change form 
Instructions to complete the provided forms.
•	Next, you and your team will participate in a hands-on activity to analyze a proposed AHI 
App development project change, complete a change form, and provide an updated status 
report.
•	You'll end the first lesson with a short, graded, seven-question quiz that focuses on essential 
monitoring and controlling, and closing concepts.
Note: This quiz is representative of the certification questions you might answer during 
the Project Management Institute (PMI) Certified Associate in Project Management 
(CAPM) certification exam.
•	Y starts with a reading that introduces the concepts of 'lessons learned,' reporting, and 
retrospectives. You'll have access to AHI App development project updates.
•	A short video demo shares a sample closeout report, including the report format and closeout 
reporting specifics.
•	Next, you and your team will complete an AHI App development project closeout report. 
You'll see a potential solution you can use for reference.
•	The second lesson includes a short, graded, seven-question quiz on project closeout 
concepts. Note that this quiz represents some of the certification questions you might answer 
on the Project Management Institute (PMI) Certified Associate in Project Management 
(CAPM) certification exam.
•	You will conclude this module with a review of a glossary of terms and the module Four 
summary
Enjoy this module the hands-on lab deliverables you create during this module will become part of 
a portfolio of artifacts you can use to demonstrate your project management expertise and readiness 
for more extensive project management responsibilities.
Reading: Review a Project and Scenario 
Update
Objective:
•	Provide an update for the AHI App development project
Update:
The AHI App development project is well into the execution phase. Here are some specific updates.
•	App development is running behind the original schedule. The team can overcome the 
schedule delays by adding a third sprint. Cary Manning shared the need for a third 
sprint with the sponsor Mary Smithers. Mary Smither's decision is pending.
•	The team is working on scope issues. Cal Hamer is working with the marketing and 
leadership team to address some requirements omitted when the team developed the 
initial user stories. There is a risk that 100% of the desired App functionality may not 
be ready in version 1.
•	The budget is on track. The project has not incurred additional costs to date. The team 
informed Mary that the initial cost estimates were erroneous. The IT team purchased 
more hardware and storage capability than needed due to misinterpreting the number of App 
users. Priya Service is evaluating IT capabilities and will share a recommendation on 
how to use the additional capacity.
•	Priya identified an additional interface equipment item required to complete the 
project. The cost is $2000. Cary is reviewing the budget to determine the impact.
•	An issue did develop regarding leadership reporting requirements. There is a high 
probability that some reporting requirements cannot be satisfied in version 1.
•	The team needs to ensure that they identify all updated requirements for the App as soon 
as possible to avoid potential delays and restarts.
•	Jose Garcia recognized a shortfall in the customer-facing design of the new App. He 
shared insight with the development team and helped avoid a potential App shortfall. Kudos 
are due. It is currently flu season. The team is hoping everyone on the team stays 
healthy.
Demo: Status Reporting Review
Welcome to Status Reporting Review.
After watching this video, you will be able to create a project status report.
Hello everyone, and welcome to a quick demonstration on a project status report.
Before we begin, let's go ahead and define the purpose of projects status reports.
First and foremost, is to ensure current status is understood by all key stakeholders.
Secondly, a good status report can help maintain interest and commitment levels.
And third, a status report should be a tool to address issues and help needed.
We have an example of a one page status report and let me repeat that last phrase, one page.
The best status reports are short.
What goes into a status report?
To begin with, we should always have the project identifier, or name.
In this particular case, we have the ABC Company All Hands Meeting.
The status report should also be dated.
Status reports are not a one and done, you're going to go ahead and submit periodic status reports 
and they will build upon one another.
Always define your name and your organization.
In most cases, the project manager is the individual who submits the status report.
In this particular case, we have Sarah Wilson who is in operations.
The next area is very, very important, deliverable status.
And the best method to report deliverable status is using what we call traffic light reporting, which 
is red, yellow, and green.
You'll notice that we have an overview of what red, yellow, and green mean.
Provide a definition that is suitable to your particular project.
The definitions that you see here may work for you or you may want to go ahead and update them, 
and make them more specific for the project that you are managing.
But the bottom line is this, ensure that when people are reporting green, red, and yellow, that 
everyone is using the same definition.
Colour codes are very, very effective.
The three key deliverable status indicators that most stakeholders are going to be interested in is 
scope, schedule, and budget, that's our triangle in a project.
What we want to do is to define the current health of the project in terms of scope, schedule, and 
budget.
And we also want to show how this particular status is trending.
You'll notice in this example, we have scope is currently yellow and trending yellow, schedule is 
fine, green and green, budget is currently green.
However, it's trending toward red.
What follows after your status is help needed.
One of the things that we want to do is to describe the help needed, and help needed is any help that 
will allow us to stay green or return to green.
Normally, a best practice is to describe the help needed in terms of a must have, a should have, or a 
like to have.
Everything should not be a must have.
So in this particular case, we have a must have.
We need to finalize the speaker agenda and who is the source for this help?
The CEO and Operations Manager.
You'll notice above, we had scope, yellow and yellow.
One of the reasons for that is because the speaker agenda has not yet been finalized.
A should have, we need to identify alternative caterer to meet some dietary needs.
And this is again, the operations manager.
And then we have another must have, we may need an additional $2,000.
The initial refreshment estimate was too low and that is assigned to the finance lead.
You'll notice our budget is currently green, but it is trending toward red because we realize that we 
are going to have a funding shortfall.
The next area is for risk, what are some new risks and changes since the last report?
So we have two risks that we can add.
Key personnel absences may impact the overall quality of the project, and limited gluten free food 
choices is driving some of the catering cost overruns.
However, we had a risk that we had reported in our last status report.
AV configuration issues have now been overcome.
What are some issues?
What is an issue?
That is a risk that occurred or questions you need to have responses for.
The food cost estimates were higher than planned, that's no longer a risk, that is an issue.
We need to know where to fit the motivational speaker in the agenda as well.
Are there any recent or pending decisions impacting the project?
Yes, finalization of required speakers is needed to plan the agenda.
And finally, any kind of comments.
And this may seem redundant, but it's not a bad thing to repeat good news, or to reiterate perhaps 
bad news or help needed.
The AV issues previously reported were resolved and the motivational speaker was identified.
Before we close this demo, just five key notes.
Number 1, keep the report brief, shorter reports are much easier to understand.
Number 2, traffic light reporting, green, yellow, and red is a best practice.
It is great to use the colours as you saw in the demo status report that we just shared.
However, remember that some people cannot see colours well, so add the verbiage.
Third, share the most important information first, people normally read from top to bottom.
Next, determine the optimal reporting frequency based on the needs of the project.
If status is slowly changing, perhaps an every other week status reporting schedule will suffice.
And finally, ensure the status report is targeted at the stakeholders who need the information.
Ensure these stakeholders have access to the report.
This concludes our demo on status reporting.
You will have the opportunity to read a scenario, analyse this scenario, and prepare a status report as 
part of your course lab requirements.
Thank you for your attention, have a great rest of your day, and we look forward to seeing you 
again for future demonstrations.

In this video, you learn that when writing a status report, you should provide an overview of the 
status, scope, and budget, review risks and provide updates on current issues, and share current 
health and forecasts.

Demo: Change Request Review
Welcome to Change Request Review.
After watching this video, you will be able to write a standard change request.
Welcome to a short demo.
For the next few minutes, we will highlight a standard change request form whose design conforms 
to a step-by-step integrated change control process championed by the Project Management 
Institute or PMI.
PMI states that all changes should be processed using the following step-by-step process step 
number one log the change.
Every change request submitted should be assigned a unique tracking number.
Step number two, ensure the purpose of the change is clearly documented.
Ensure the reason for the change or the benefits are shared.
Step number three, evaluate the change.
Clearly define the impact to the project baseline if the change is approved as written.
Step number four, provide implementation options.
How can this change be accomplished?
Develop your team's recommended approach.
And finally, step number five, document the decision and reasons why the decision was reached.
Update all project documentation and communicate the change.
With that, let's walk through an example of a change form.
First of all, complete information to include the project stakeholder information and ensure a 
change ID is assigned.
Next, ensure the proposed change is detailed at an appropriate level to ensure understanding of the 
request.
This is accomplished by the requester and validated by the team.
Ensure the reason for the change is described, this is also accomplished by the requester.
Consider the impact to the project baseline and stakeholders.
List assumptions, dependencies, risks and define approval levels for the change.
Define implementation options, most changes will impact scope, schedule, and budget.
Describe the impact for each potential option provided.
Always ensure the team makes a recommendation on the most feasible option.
Finally, document the decision.
This may include accept as-is, accept with modifications, defer, reject or recommend further 
analysis.
Add notes to justify the decision and use the close out checklist to ensure the change is processed 
properly.

In this video, you learn that, a change request should include a request ID,
a description, an evaluation of the change options, and then explain the decision.

Scenario: Develop an Application (App) to 
Provide Real-Time Marketing Data
The AHI development team is ready to report the project status (refer to the Review a Project and 
Scenario Update reading).
In addition, the team also received a change request. It now needs to perform an impact analysis and 
provide implementation options.
Exercise 1: Create a Project Status Report
1.	Keeping the CTRL key pressed, click here to download the Project Status Report 
Template document. 
Note: On Mac systems, keep the COMMAND key pressed instead of the CTRL key.
2.	Refer to the Review a Project and Scenario Update reading.
3.	Open the Project Status Report Template document and fill in the details.
4.	Keeping the CTRL key pressed, click here to download the Project Status Report 
Potential Solution document. 
Note: On Mac systems, keep the COMMAND key pressed instead of the CTRL key.
5.	Open the Project Status Report Potential Solution document and compare your report 
with the given solution.
6.	Save your project status report with a meaningful name and as a PDF, such as the AHI 
Project Status Report.
Use these directions to save a Word document as a PDF if you do not know how 
already. You will need to upload a PDF for your final project.
Exercise 2: Analyze a Change Request
1.	Keeping the CTRL key pressed, click here to download the Change Request Form 
document. 
Note: On Mac systems, keep the COMMAND key pressed instead of the CTRL key.
2.	Open the Change Request Form document and review the given change request.
3.	Analyze the impact analysis and list your findings in the form.
4.	Recommend options for implementation and list them in the form.
5.	Perform decision recommendations. They include:
•	Accept as is
•	Accept with modifications
•	Defer
•	Reject
•	Further analysis required
6.	Save your change request form with a meaningful name and as a PDF, such as the AHI 
Change Request Analysis.
Module 4: Lessons Learned Report and 
Retrospectives
Objectives:
•	Explain the importance and process of conducting lessons learned
•	Summarize the Retrospective purpose and facilitation process
•	Review the final AHI App development project status
Introduction:
You can use lessons learned and retrospectives to identify threats to performance, project 
team cohesion, methods, and so on. They can also help identify practices and opportunities.
Lessons Learned:
At the end of each major anticipatory phase of the project, you list the lessons learned. You also 
perform them at the end of the project.
•	Lessons learned help project managers improve project performance. They document what 
went well and what could have gone better. They also include recommendations for 
improving future project performance.
•	The project manager is responsible for implementing lessons learned documenting 
results. The Project Management Institute (PMI) recommends that all lessons learned be 
recorded in a register. All stakeholders can review this register.
•	The Project Manager may need to tailor the lessons learned process to meet the 
organization's needs.
Retrospectives:
•	Retrospectives are conducted at the end of each Scrum Sprint. This is a ceremony 
facilitated by a Scrum Master. Retrospectives are like lessons learned. The team has to 
answer three questions. They include what went well, what can be improved in the next 
Sprint, and what we should change as a team.
•	There is one big difference between lessons learned and a retrospective. The team votes on 
one significant change they will implement immediately in the next Sprint before the 
Retrospective is complete. The Scrum Master documents this change recommendation and 
ensures the team adopts the change immediately.
•	In a Retrospective, there are several methods used for voting.
•	Majority: A change is agreed to if more than 50% of the team agrees.
•	Unanimity: The change is adopted only if 100% of the team agree.
•	Plurality: You can divide the teams according to areas of expertise. This method 
results in the vote of the numerically largest internal group.
•	Fist to Five: "Fist to Five" is a technique for getting feedback or checking consensus 
during a meeting. The Scrum Master presents a recommendation for change. All 
team members are asked to show how much they agree with the statement. 
Participants hold up a certain number of fingers, from five for complete agreement to 
one clenched fist for complete disagreement.
AHI App Development Project Update:
•	The team described five solutions or objectives in the project charter. At the end of the 
project, the app was developed within the specified time frame. The app did not 
include all features as originally planned. Two required data feeds and a number of 
desired reports were not included. Inadequate requirements gathering at the beginning of the 
project resulted in several change requests. The team will incorporate the outstanding 
requirements into version 2.
•	The team added a third Sprint and developed the app within the 90-day development 
window. Additional costs of $7000 were incurred due to equipment requirement 
omissions and inflationary cost factors not considered during initial planning. A few 
minor App interface issues still need to be remedied. IT has forecasted a 15 November 
completion date.
•	Feedback from the customer focus group was positive. The new App satisfied their 
requirements for improved access to all AHI products and pricing and provided secure 
invoicing and order processing as required.
•	IT encountered recruiting issues. They could find and hire only one qualified candidate to 
fill the two vacancies and approved positions. IT is working with Human Relations (HR) to 
add a second new hire. They hope to have a second new hire onboarded by 1 December.
•	The team felt that initial scrum training would have been a great benefit. The 
development team mixed traditional predictive and adaptive methods during the Sprints. 
The team determined that applying a more structured Scrum process would be 
beneficial.
•	Development team velocity was based on assumptions. In the future, the team will strive 
to understand better how much work measured by story points the team can achieve in each 
Sprint.


Demo: Project Close-out Report


Welcome to Project Close out Report.
After watching this video, you will be able to: describe the importance of a project close-out report,
and explain the steps involved in writing a project close-out report.
Welcome to a brief demo on completing a final project close-out report.
A project close-out report is important for a number of reasons.
A project close-out report allows the team and future project managers to learn from both the 
mistakes and successes of a specific project.
All too often, history in the form of mistakes repeats itself.
In addition, best practices learned are often lost.
A high-quality close-out report will help improve future project performance.
Project closure reports are also important, because they serve as a basis to close contracts, 
release project resources, communicate vital information to stakeholders, and plan the 
product or service transition.
A project closeout report is documented to identify the variances from the baseline plans.
This includes comparing planned performance to actual performance in the areas of scope, 
schedule, cost, and risk management.
Let's do a quick report review.
First of all, always date the report and provide key information to provide the project name.
In addition, your division, or department as applicable, the project sponsor, and the project 
manager.
Next, review the project charter, document the original goals of the project.
Review each goal in the previous section.
Evaluate your success or failure in achieving each goal.
This is in essence your project report card.
Next, review your project management plan.
What was the original scope, schedule, and cost baselines?
Compare what actually occurred on the project versus what was planned.
Identify variances, and most importantly, provide ideas on how these variances can be 
avoided on future projects.
Reveal your risk register.
What risks did you predict accurately, and how did your responses fair?
In addition, document risks that caught you by surprise.
How can these surprises be prevented in the future?
Work with the team, and document any outstanding issues that remain to be addressed.
Do not close out the project totally until these issues are resolved.
Lessons learned are next.
Gather the team and document what went well, what you can do better next time, and provide 
any recommendations to improve.
This activity will not help the current project in all likelihood, but it will help future project 
managers immensely.
Determine where the report will be archived or filed.
Find a repository where all project managers have access to the report.
Finally, document when lessons learned were accomplished, and when the project closeout 
was 100 percent complete.
Do, and I emphasize do, take the time to prepare and share this report.
Overall, project management within your organization will in all likelihood improve.

In this video, you learned that project close-out help the team learn from mistakes and successes, 
serve to communicate final information to stakeholders, and identify variances from baseline plans.
When writing a project close-out, you should document the original goals of the project, and 
evaluate the success of each goal.
Provide advice on how variances can be avoided in the future.
Document risks, explain lessons learned, and include the final 100 percent completion date.

Purpose
A personal portfolio is a great way to share who you are, showcase the work you have 
accomplished, and demonstrate that you have the skills to excel in a potential new role. A well-
organized portfolio can set you apart from the rest. Here is a summary of personal portfolio 
attributes:
•	Visually demonstrates competencies you would list on a resume or share in an interview
•	Provides proof of your skills, accomplishments, and examples of your work
•	Includes a compilation of some of your best work samples and professional documentation
•	It may be as simple as a binder, or electronically compiled
•	Allows you to SHOW and not simply TELL
Portfolio contents
Your portfolio should be unique and tailored to the role you are pursuing. Tailor the content to serve 
your needs. General contents to consider including:
•	Headshot, brief biographical information, and contact information
•	A personal statement, your career goals, your likes, and your passions
•	Career summary (resume), educational experience, licenses, and certifications
•	Information about past employers and your evaluations
•	List of skills and photos of you at work
•	Published articles, press releases, accolades, and testimonials
•	References
•	Create a contents section and provide links to your best work
Steps to build a portfolio
•	Step 1: Gather materials. Choose examples that are recent, relevant, and significant.
•	Step 2: Organize the portfolio. Include a table of contents and appropriate headers.
•	Step 3: Create a visually appealing portfolio. Maintain consistency in formatting. Quantity 
does not necessarily equate to quality.

Demo: Personal Portfolio Development
Welcome to Personal Portfolio Development.
After watching this video, you will be able to describe the elements of a personal portfolio.
Welcome to a brief overview of how to develop a personal work portfolio.
As we shared in an earlier reading, a personal portfolio is a great way to showcase your work and
demonstrate you have the skills required to satisfy a potential job role.
This short demo will provide an idea of what to include in your portfolio and how to format your 
presentation.
A portfolio can be a hard copy document or an electronic one.
Share your name, title, and contact information.
Always include a picture.
Try to share a variety of pictures throughout the portfolio.
Provide a brief introduction.
Tailor your introduction, so it resonates with the audience you are sharing your portfolio with.
Provide a brief agenda.
You may wish to reference the slide or page number, or turn this into a mini table of contents.
Again, a picture is worth 1000 words and vary your pictures.
The next section provides a miniature persona of yourself.
Share your goals, if possible, try to share goals that the portfolio viewer might embrace as well.
Express your values, again, do your homework.
What values do you possess that would be appreciated by the reader and the organization you are 
targeting?
Share your likes. What drives you?
What are you passionate about?
Always ask yourself, how will my likes add value to the role I am seeking?
Consider a quote that expresses your passion and values, this is optional.
However, if you have a favorite quote or saying that matches the vision or values of the 
organization or role you are targeting, add it.
Always include an overview of your education and certifications.
You don't need to list everything.
Determine which educational and certification particulars support the position you hope to attain, 
and list your job history.
Share your last three or four roles that show you have the experience needed to take that next big 
career step.
Share pictures of you on the job.
Try to have a good mix of you working by yourself and with others.
Choose pictures that show your passion, ability to effectively collaborate, and your professionalism 
on the job.
Again, do your homework, try to choose examples of your work that are meaningful to the portfolio 
reader and pertinent to the role you hope to attain.
Try to limit this part of your portfolio to your hardest hitting top three examples.
Describe the work, share how this work provided positive results, and finally, share a link to the 
work.
Give the reader an opportunity to view the work in detail.
Here's another example of sharing your best work.
This is example number 2.
And here is another example of you sharing your best work, this is example number 3.
Share references, find individuals who work in meaningful positions willing to advocate for you, if 
possible, pictures add impact.
You may wish to add contact information to these references as well.
Provide a brief summary, reiterate who you are, what you stand for, and the value you can bring to 
an organization.
This is your final elevator pitch, tailor this section to the audience.
Always end with a thank you to those who took the time to review your portfolio, reiterate your 
contact information and your smile.
>> In this video, you learned elements of a personal portfolio may include contact information and 
a picture agenda or a table of contents.
Develop a persona for yourself, overview of pertinent education and certifications, work samples 
representing your best work, and work samples that are pertinent to the role, references, and an 
elevator pitch.

suggestions.
